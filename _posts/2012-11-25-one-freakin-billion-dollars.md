title: One Freakin' Billion Dollars

One Billion Dollars. That is a one with nine zeros. Looks like this: $1,000,000,000. Nice, eh?

Imagine what you could do with $1BN?

You could put yourself into the shoes of Elon Musk, create Space X and launch a rocket into space, dock with the International Space Station and essentially do something freakin' awesome.

Or you can buy a stupid photo-sharing app which makes every picture you take with the camera of your $800 smartphone look like it comes straight out of my Lomo which I bought on the flea market in Berlin for a cool 5 Euros.

Please. Do something meaningful with your life.
