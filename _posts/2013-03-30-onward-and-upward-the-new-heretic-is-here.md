title: Onward and Upward - The NEW Heretic is here!
---
The Heretic came to life as an experiment. I wanted to have a way to share thoughts and ideas which felt less polished than a blog post and more meaningful than a tweet.

So I set up a newsletter. Originally I planned on sending an email every once in a while, talking about whatever comes to mind. Turns out – I obsess about entrepreneurship, startups, makers, creators, rebels and misfits. People and ideas who change the world. And so I ended up sending out my little newsletter to a small and growing community of like-minded people on a daily basis.

**Four months and 118 posts later we are a tribe.**

Today I take the wraps off [The *NEW* Heretic](http://theheretic.me/): Over the last couple of weeks I've rebuild the complete website – some highlights:

- All pages are mobile-friendly
- You can leave public comments for each post
- Revamped [Archive](http://theheretic.me/archive/) with category-filters for endless hours of reading fun
- Completely new [About](http://theheretic.me/about/) page featuring **The Heretic Manifesto**

I am incredibly proud of this; and this is only the beginning. I hope you enjoy the new design – and send me an email if you see something which is broken or doesn't behave the way you expect it to.

**Onward & Upward.**

P.S. You think my writing smacks you on the nose from time to time? Go and check out the visuals on [TheHeretic.me](http://theheretic.me/)! ;)
