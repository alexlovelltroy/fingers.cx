title: Your Culture
---
The best companies usually have a very strong corporate culture. Culture is something which you have to live and breath every single day. You have to lead by example. Talk about it often and extensively – and make sure you publicly live your values and believes.

It's easy to put your values on the wall. It means nothing. It's about behavior. Culture is really just how people behave when they think you're not looking.
