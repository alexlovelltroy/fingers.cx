title: Introducing The Heretic Network
---
On Sunday I [asked](http://theheretic.me/2013/12/08/the-heretic-network/), on a whim, if any of our fellow Heretic tribe members would like to pay it forward and offer their expertise to our little community.

Little did I know how **awesome** you all are! <del>57 (fifty-seven)</del> 64 (sixty-four) of you emailed me and said: "I'm in!".

Without much further ado I introduce to you:

[The Heretic Network](http://theheretic.me/network/)

Here's what I want you to do: **Use this amazing resource!** 

Check out the profiles, reach out to people, form bonds and build amazing stuff together. And [drop me a line](mailto:hello@theheretic.me) when something awesome happened to you!

**You guys are freakin' amazing!**
