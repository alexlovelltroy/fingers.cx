title: The Right Stuff
---
Every entrepreneur starts out with three things. These three things are the essence of every entrepreneur. Understanding, appreciating, cultivating and leveraging these three things make or break an entrepreneur.

Every entrepreneur begins with three categories of means:

1. **Who they are** – their traits, tastes and abilities.
2. **What they know** – their education, training, expertise and experience.
3. **Whom they know** – their social and professional network.

Everything the entrepreneur creates is based on these means.

**This is the right stuff.**

Ask yourself: Who are you? What do you know? Whom do you know? Now – what can you create with this?
