title: Love your Customer
---
I strongly believe that the only way you can build something your customers love is to love your customer. Only if you care deeply about your customer and her problems, issues and opportunities will you be able to create something truly outstanding.

The best teams, building the best solutions often build something for people they know intimately or have studied extensively and developed deep empathy for.

When you hire look for people who care as deeply about your customer than you â€“ and then some.

Just ask yourself: Why should a customer care about you when you don't care about her?
