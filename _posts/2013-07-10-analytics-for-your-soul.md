subtitle: How do you measure the impact you make within your community, smiles, hugs, birthday cards? Meaningful Human Connections?

summary: I'm building intros.to for quantifiable data on how effective I am at helping those around me because social networking can be alienating.

Social networking brings numbers into our lives that seem to represent our human connections, but do they? 

With Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter, collecting friends and connections becomes a game.  Collect them All!  And, it's fun to add more, to reconnect with someone from your past or meet a new friend.  It's even tempting to use these numbers as a proxy for popularity or even to quantify human connections.

####Selfish numbers
> You have 500+ connections on LinkedIn and 1500 friends on facebook who have liked your 5000 pictures or posts 20,000 times, and your 2000 twitter followers have created 700 retweets of your ideas.

Each of those numbers is a selfish number. Growth in follower number or like number doesn't necessarily increase the happiness in the world.  The truth is, we don't have a good set of numbers to use as a proxy for happiness, where we're helping the most or how much interactions matter.

In my personal and professional life, I make a lot of introductions that lead to meaningful human connections.  These are what you might call "happy" connections - I feel good making them, and they make others feel good. Getting feedback, and knowing how I've helped others, increases my happiness even further. Directly: it's great to know what the seed you planted grew into. And indirectly: if I know what worked for one person, I can make even better intros next time, for another.

I'm a programmer, so I'm excited to be building something that does just this, and more. [Intros](http://intros.to) helps connectors simply track the intros they make, increase their impact - and, in doing so, their happiness.
