title: Finding Your Co-Founders
---
One of the questions I get asked a lot is "How do I find my co-founder?". The question always leaves me baffled – as it's such a personal and individual thing. Over the years I have heard anything from "my co-founder is my brother – literally" to "we met at a bar and got completely wasted".

With that being said – here's probably my best piece of advice on this particular subject (and no – it's not rocket science, so don't get your hopes up):

Create a list of all the people you would want to start a company with. Then ask.

Start that list now. Even if you don't want to start a company at the moment. It might come handy in the future. And if not – at least you have a list of all the awesome people in your life.

Remember: This is a lot like dating. You will go through some very painful experiences with your co-founder. Make sure that she/he doesn't only tick all the boxes in the skill set department but that you actually like each other. Go for a hike, drink a few beers together, find a topic you strongly disagree about and argue. Take your time. This is probably the most important decision in your startup.
