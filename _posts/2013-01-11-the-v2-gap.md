title: The v2 Gap
---
You have the first iteration of your product out of the door. Your v1 is launched. Congratulations. Now it's time to think about v2. And here's were it often goes wrong (especially if you are in a big(ger) company).

The v1 is often the product of a bunch of people hacking stuff together. It's driven by constrains - it lacks features, some of the stuff isn't polished… but… you got it out of the door. Mostly in time and on budget.

v2 is different. This is where a lot of companies start the feature creep. This is where you add all the shit which is sitting on your todo list. This is where big companies suddenly take 10 to 100 times the people to get it done. And it won't be on time or budget.

You can change that. It is in your control to make sure your next version is actually better, is delivered on time and on budget. It's a fight. A fight of saying no. A lot of NOs.
