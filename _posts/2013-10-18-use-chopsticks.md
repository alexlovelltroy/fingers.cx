title: Use Chopsticks
---
*The following guest post is from a good friend and fellow Heretic [Matej Novak](http://matejnovak.com/), a copywriter with a deep passion for language and branding.*

I was born in 1977 in what was then communist Czechoslovakia. We ate with knives and forks. Sometimes spoons. Going out to dinner was something special, an occasion, and eating with chopsticks made it even more so. It presented a challenge, but also created memories and an opportunity to learn.

Your background may be different, so this exact metaphor may not work for you. But it's not really about chopsticks. It's not even about food. It's about changing your routine from time to time, trying new things and appreciating the world and your life in a new way.

**1) Slow down**
Small bites. One piece a time. Chew. It's not always just about the destination. The process and journey are just as important â€” sometimes more. Take the time to notice. Important learning happens along the way.

**2) Make it special**
Turn something ordinary into an occasion. Involve friends and family. Celebrate, even the little things (especially the little things). Don't wait for these situations to present themselves. Create them yourself.

**3) Turn it into a ritual**
Ritual and ceremony are incredibly powerful. How many times have you gone to sleep in your life? How many of those do you remember? Find ways to change habits. Perform routine tasks in new ways.

It's amazing how easily you can incorporate these things into your life. They don't take a lot of time or effort, even if it may feel that way at first. Try them one at a time. Combine them. You don't have to do all (or even any) of them every day, but when you do, it can be very rewarding.

When I think back to some of my favorite experiences, the ones that really stand out in my mind, the ones I most wish I could go back and relive, they all have at least a couple of these things in common.
