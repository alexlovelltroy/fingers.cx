title: Choose Your Perspective
---
I spent the last three days at the Coaches Institute (CTI) as part of the training I am doing. This weekend we spent time on perspectives – the notion that you can't help it but see the world through the filter of our chosen perspective.

We talked about this earlier: There is a fundamental difference in the sentence "I don't have time" and "It is not a priority for me". Same underlying truth – different outcomes.

The thing you need to burn into your memory is: You are at choice. Always. You might not be able to change the circumstances – but you surely can change your perspective.

Once you have internalized this – you will not be able to go back to your old self and allow yourself to be a victim of the circumstances. You are truly the master of your own destiny.
