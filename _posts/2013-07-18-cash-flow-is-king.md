title: Cash (Flow) is King
---
I'm beating this drum for quite a while now: Cash Flow Matters.

Instead of repeating the old argument again and again - head over to Unreasonable.is and read my [recent post](http://unreasonable.is/opinion/cash-flow-matters/) on the subject.

Recently Ben Horowitz (of [Andreessen Horowitz](http://a16z.com/)-fame) published a blog post about "[Capital Market Climate Change](http://bhorowitz.com/2013/07/16/capital-market-climate-change/)" which concluded in the following statement:

*"The only surefire antidote to capital market climate change is positive cash flow. If you generate cash, investors mean nothing. If you do not, then your success will depend upon the kindness of strangers."*

**This is precisely it. Cash flow matters.**
