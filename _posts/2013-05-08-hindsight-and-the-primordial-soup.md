title: Hindsight and the Primordial Soup
---
People tell me the success of Firefox was obvious. The market was ripe for disruption, the Web was ripe for explosive growth, the stars were aligned. Right time, right product, right place.

And yet: That's not how it works.

I wasn't around back then; everyone who was tells me that it was far from obvious. That it was a massive gamble and that the chances of success seemed slim.

Hindsight skews your view. When you are in the moment you are in the midst of the primordial soup. Everything is murky. Every move is a risk. Success is not a given but a gamble.

Embrace the chaos. It is what it is. And when you're successful smile and nod when people tell you that your success was "obvious".
