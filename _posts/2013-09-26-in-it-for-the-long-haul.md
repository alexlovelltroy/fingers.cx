title: In It For The Long Haul
---
My former boss and now partner at venture capital firm Greylock tweeted the following observation a little while ago:

> [@johnolilly](https://twitter.com/johnolilly): So my advice to a bunch of folks lately is to remember that life is long, careers are long. We'll all be doing this together for a while.

I couldn't agree more. It's incredibly helpful to put things into perspective and realize that what we perceive as frenetic, moment-to-moment decisions take on a very different view when seen through the long lens. Be it your [personal career](http://unreasonable.is/opinion/take-the-long-view-on-your-career/) or the [strategic direction of your company](http://99u.com/articles/7255/the-jeff-bezos-school-of-long-term-thinking) â€“ once you get to a longer-term vantage point your decisions will shift. Arguably for the better.

**We'll all be doing this together for a while.**
