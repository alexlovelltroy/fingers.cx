title: Know your own Success Metrics
---
## What will it feel like to succeed?

When starting a business, you should be measuring and testing everything to see what moves the needle.  Iterate based on feedback from tested hypotheses and solid metrics.

Can you do the same thing with your life?  How do you know when you've personally succeeded?  What moves the needle in your soul?

It’s useful to start with a few questions set in an imaginary future where you have succeeded.  By looking back, you'll trick your mind into collapsing all the possibilities into one narrative.  The future is unwritten, wide, and free, but the past is set in stone.

**How is the world different because your company succeeded?**  Be specific with numbers or deliverables.  Think of this as something that someone else could verify.

**How is your life different because your company succeeded?**  This should be specific too, but grade yourself here.  How do you feel?  What do you want?  Where are you?

**What is the one thing that you’re most proud of in the journey here?**

**How long did it take for you to get here?**

**Who do you see as your successor and how did you find him/her?**

Use the questions as a guide to think about the circumstances as if they have already happened.    Run through it a few times and aim for different answers.  Where are the changes?  What stays the same?  

###How do you feel?
