title: The Single Founder
---
Every once in a while I meet someone who tells me that they are working on this awesome idea… Alone.

Single founders.

Big red flag.

Don't get me wrong – there is nothing inherently wrong with you working on your idea alone; pulling a superman and be the sole founder of your company.

Here is where it breaks down: First of all – successfully building a company requires a multitude of skills. You need to be able to build the product, market it, sell it, service it. That's a lot of hats to wear – and I bet you money that you won't be awesome at all of them. Secondly it shows that you either were not able to convince anyone else to join you and help build your awesome idea or you are hard to work with. Both are not great indicators. Thirdly – unless you are a proven entrepreneur you will very most likely not find an investor (for reason 1 and 2 above). And lastly – building a company is freaking hard (we talked about this many times here). You want someone on your side, trust me.

So – find your startup soulmate(s). Build an outstanding team – as only outstanding teams can build outstanding things.
