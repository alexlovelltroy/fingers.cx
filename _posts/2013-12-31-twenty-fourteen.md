We are less than seven hours away from stepping into the new year. Looking back at 2013 - it has been an incredible journey for a lot of us. From embarking onto new adventures, starting businesses, shutting down businesses, standing by our loved ones as they encounter obstacles and celebrate victoriesâ€¦

I couldn't be happier, prouder and more fulfilled than being able to do this all alongside you - The Heretic Tribe. If I had one wish for the next year - it is that you all live your lives by this motto:

**"A Child has no trouble believing the unbelievable, nor does the genius or the madman. It's only you and I, with our big brains and our tiny hearts, who doubt and overthink and hesitate." ~ Steven Pressfield**

Be a child. A Genius. A Madman!

Twenty-Fourteen will be epic. **BECAUSE WE MAKE IT SO!**

Happy New Year my dear fellow Heretics!
