A long time ago I met someone who's online nick was TYBT.

**To Yourself Be True.**

You are at your best when you are your authentic self. When you give yourself full permission to be who you are. When you give a damn about what "others" think, say or do. When you follow your true passion.

This requires that you actually know your authentic self. Spent time figuring out where your true passions lie, what makes you unique, what you're good at and where you suck. Ask others for their feedback.

And even when life requires us to put on a mask from time to time - always be true to yourself.

Too many young entrepreneurs forget this and became caricatures of others. People they think they need to emulate, manors they feel they need to adopt, things they believe they need to do.

**TYBT.**

**We need you. And more of you.**
