title: A Guided Tour of Macintosh
---
In October 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh in Germany at the leading "office & computer" trade show [Orgatec](http://www.orgatec.com/en/orgatec/home/index.php) in Cologne. At the time Orgatec was considered the biggest and most influential computer trade show in Germany ([CeBIT](http://www.cebit.de/home) was still part of the [Hannover Messe](http://www.hannovermesse.de/home) and hash't yet become the palooza it is today).

My dad ordered one of the first Macs available in Germany at that show. 128 kilobytes of RAM, single 400 kilobyte floppy drive, no hard disk. Hard to imagine these days. And yet - it was the most incredible piece of technology.

This original Mac came with a set of software - all on 3.5" floppy disks: The system itself, MacWrite and MacPaint as well as a set of "Guided Tours". One for the Macintosh, the other for MacWrite and MacPaint. These tours were semi-automatically running applications which came with an audio cassette to provide the narration and instructions.

Recently I came across the old tapes my dad still had in storage and digitized them. For a true "blast from the past" - here are the tapes (for some added fun - they are in German):

**A Guided Tour to Macintosh** (Note: The tape is identical on both sides)

**BONUS:** While going through a box of old stuff I also found the original manual, two brochures for the Macintosh and the very first edition of MACup, the first German Macintosh computer magazine. [Here's a photoset of these items](http://on.snapjoy.com/s/ks5KjN4puJPPAbph3zfjriPOUNYwqM8Dlwc9RI9JHw).
