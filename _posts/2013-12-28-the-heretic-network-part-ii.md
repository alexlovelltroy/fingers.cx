title: The (Heretic) Network - Part II
---
Nope. Not part II of the dreadful movie ("All new! This time it's even more epic! Watch the drama as a company without revenue goes public! The Network - Part II: Rise of the Twitter Fail Whale." ;)) but our own Heretic Network:

Three weeks ago [I asked the tribe](http://theheretic.me/2013/12/08/the-heretic-network/) if some of you would be willing to pay it forward and help other Heretics on their respective journeys. I hoped for twenty people to raise their hands. Fifty would have defied gravity. Three short weeks later the [Heretic Network](http://theheretic.me/network/) is 119 people strong. One Hundred Nineteen! I encourage you to view this Network as your extended rolodex of awesomeness. Your pool of trusted advisors who can and will help you. And when the time is right - please pay it forward and help someone else.

As awesome as the Network is - it's a rolodex, not something which facilitates communication for the tribe as a whole. Yesterday I created a new home for us: [A private Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/theheretic/). As with the Network and everything else here at The Heretic it's a big experiment for me - I don't know if it will be useful, I don't know how we will use itâ€¦ and that's the beauty of it.

**This is OURS. Turn it into whatever is useful for you.**
