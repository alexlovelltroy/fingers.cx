title: Hacking the System
---
I love it when people hack the system. There is a guy who creates short videos explaining the proper English pronunciation of words - such as [pneumonia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWh90XkWTM4). His videos all look the same - a gray background with the word written in Helvetica. He made more than [700 of these videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/pronunciationbook?feature=watch).

Now there is someone else who creates videos which look the same but are complete spoofs. The pronunciation is hilarious - for example his version of [pneumonia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvlRiI-K3A0). This guy also produced more than [200 of these videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/PronunciationManual?feature=watch).

When you do a YouTube search for "[pronunciation pneumonia](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=pronunciation+pneumonia&oq=pronunciation+pneumonia&gs_l=youtube-reduced.3...263285.264779.0.265227.3.3.0.0.0.0.71.170.3.3.0...0.0...1ac.1j2.dQOrORgF-cI)" both videos show up. Looking exactly the same. One video has more than 218,000 views, the other a mere 11,000. Guess which one is the proper one and which is the prank.

What a brilliant hack.

Oh - and the moral of the story: Don't trust the Interwebs. :)
