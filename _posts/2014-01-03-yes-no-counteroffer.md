title: Yes, No Or Counteroffer
---
One of the most powerful concepts in co-active coaching (the type of executive coaching Jane and I are trained in) is "Yes, No or Counteroffer": Whenever we make a request of our coachee (i.e. we ask the coachee to do something and will hold her accountable for it) she has the opportunity to accept, decline or make a counteroffer.

The power of this seemingly simple idea lies in the fact that **you have to make a decision**. I won't let you off the hook - something we all tend to do way to often in life. It's perfectly fine to decline - but it means you have to make an active choice. No wavering, no "let me think about it", no "let's talk about this later". **Yes, No or Counteroffer.**

I'm using this concept in all kinds of interactions and all the time now - it's incredibly powerful. Try it out!

P.S. You can say yes, no or make a counteroffer to my request to try it out. Just don't wave it away. :)
