title: The Intricacies of Financing
---
Over the last few days I discussed debt financing (convertible notes) with a young founder – she's in the process of raising her first outside investment in the form of a convertible note. While we were talking I realized that a lot of entrepreneurs have a somewhat limited knowledge of the topic; which is too bad as it puts you into a massive disadvantage in a field where you pretty much can make or break your company.

Luckily there are a couple of resources which are terrific and will get you from 0 to 100 in no time:

- [Brad Feld's Term Sheet](http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/category/term-sheet) series of blog posts is incredible.
- [Ask the VC's series on convertible debt](http://www.askthevc.com/wp/archives/category/convertible-debt-2) is fantastic reading if you want to raise debt.
- And if you really want to learn the ropes – Brad Feld's and Jason Mendelson's book [Venture Deals](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470929820/vglnk-c6-20) is a must-read.

I highly recommend spending some time with these topics – the more comfortable you feel with the lingua and the way you can get screwed over, the better your deal will be. :)

*[ADDED AUGUST 13]* Our fellow Heretic [Adam Scheuring](http://twitter.com/admsch) pointed this [fantastic primer on Convertible Notes](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-today/aa0e22f444c9) out. Read it.
