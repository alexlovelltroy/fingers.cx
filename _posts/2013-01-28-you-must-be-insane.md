title: You must be insane
---
Today a colleague of mine walked me through an in-depth analysis of the economic viability of app marketplaces and the developers who are selling their apps on those.

A mere 18% of all developers on iOS make more than $500 per month. Eighteen Percent! And within this group you still have a very strong long-tail distributionâ€¦

Which essentially translates into: You must be insane if you think you can earn a living by creating an app.

This is obviously only one side of the medallion. The entrepreneurs who do their homework, who understand their market, who have multi-pronged market strategies, who have a strong strategy built upon solid research will prevail and even thrive.

**Be one of them.**
