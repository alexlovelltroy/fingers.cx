title: Make 2013 Awesome
---
Dear Heretics,

Frohes Neues Jahr (as we say in German). What started out as a little experiment turned into quite a joyful little community of amazing people (aka **you**). So let's continue this into the new year - and make it awesome.

We start out with a full archive of past editions of The Heretic - if you're new to The Heretic or have missed an issue, fret not. [They are all here now.](http://theheretic.me/archive/)

Then I would like to try two things out with you:

1) I would love to hear your questions and suggestions. Have anything you want my opinion on, share with me or just want to hear me rant? Send me an email to hello@theheretic.me and we'll get it into The Heretic.

2) As some of you know - I am pretty obsessed with good pitches. A great pitch is art. It's entertaining and has the listener on the edge of their seats. Let's make Sunday "Pitch Sunday" - I will provide feedback on your pitch (your slide deck to be precise), one slide at a time. And we'll make sure that any information which is sensitive is removed or obfuscated before we share. If that sounds like something you want to take me up on - send me an email.

And lastly - all fellow Heretics (aka **you**) are amazing. I know that you will do spectacular things in 2013. Make it so!
