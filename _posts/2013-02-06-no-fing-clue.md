title: No f'ing clue

Yep. That was me when I started my first company.

**I had no fucking clue.**

Literally.

And yet I managed to raise millions of dollars in venture funding, built a fantastic team, convinced global brands such as Yahoo to be our customers and sold the company in the end.

What I missed in knowledge and experience I made up in audacity, guts, fearlessness and the deep-rooted desire to learn.

**This can be you. You just need to want it enough.**
