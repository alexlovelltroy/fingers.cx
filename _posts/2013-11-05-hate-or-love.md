title: Hate Or Love
---
Whatever you do – aim for emotion. Make people passionately love you, your product or your company. And understand that when some people love you, others will hate you.

The worst possible state is mediocrity – as it's boring and exhausting.

Too often do I see entrepreneurs who don't want to offend anyone and thus end up in a sea of blandness. Their products don't excite, their statements are conformist and in an attempt to appeal to the "broad masses" they loose their edge.

Have an opinion and voice it. Have an edge. We don't need any more mediocrity in our lives. All the other guys are already taking care of that.
