title: The Time is Now
---
If you think about starting something – now is the time.

Don't put it off. Don't wait for something to happen, for the stars to align, for the end of the month, for someone to give you permission, for just one more iteration of your plan, for just one more vote of confidence. Now is the time.

To all the young (and not so young) entrepreneurs I've met over the years who were **thinking** about starting something: Don't think – Act. Start now.

To all the people who had a thousand and one good reason to put it off for just one more day, week, month, year: You can't build anything if you don't start. Put yourself out there and begin.

To everyone who jumped off the cliff, who stepped far outside of their comfort zone, who dared – You are my heroes. You change the world.

**The time is now my friends. Stop talking. Start doing.**
