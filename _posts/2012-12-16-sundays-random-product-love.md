Keeping this whole newsletter experiment quirky - here's my personal product recommendation of the day: As some of you know I am pretty obsessed with (messenger) bags. Since my days in high school I am looking for the one, the perfect bag.

I think I found one which I really, really like.

Check out [Mission Workshop's](http://missionworkshop.com/) Messenger Bags - I recently bought [The Monty](http://missionworkshop.com/products/bags/messenger/roll_top/small_monty.php) in stealthy black with a black buckle and **love** it.
