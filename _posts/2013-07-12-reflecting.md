[Jane](http://janefinette.com/) had an accident today. Fell of her horse this morning. I got the call that she was brought into the ER just when I arrived at work.

Luckily she's just badly bruised. No broken bones, no torn ligaments, no damage to the head or spine.

A few hours later my friend and co-founder of [Zeega](http://zeega.com), Jesse Shapins sent me the following link:

Watch it. Click through it. Spend the two minutes it takes to listen to it fully.

It made me cry.

This morning I started the day with a very different intent and thought. Then this happened. And everything is different now.
