Do you remember the first time you jumped from the 3 meter diving board when you were a kid? If you were anything like me your heart was beating hard in your chest, your knees felt like butter, your breathing was elevated and a weird mixture between anticipation and fear ruled your body. And then you jump.

Being an entrepreneur always reminded me of that feeling. Every day you do something you have never done before. You do something which is way out of your league. You interact with people who are so much more successful and smarter than you. You keep asking yourself "What am I doing here?"

**Jump.**

You will be just fine.
