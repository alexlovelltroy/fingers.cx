title: Is the Internet soon to be owned by Big Corp?
---
Over the last couple of days these two articles caught my eye: [Google experimenting with free mobile access to its web services in developing markets](http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/8/3617164/google-free-zone-mobile-internet-access-philippines) and [How every smartphone could become a Facebook phone](http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/16/3653848/why-every-phone-could-be-a-facebook-phone).

As much as one can applaud these companies for giving free Internet access to people who might not be able to afford it otherwise - it leaves one wondering. Given that both Google and Facebook are publicly traded companies which have clear obligations toward their shareholders I am not sure if this is a healthy trend.

Remind me to tell you my eBay story one day. Wonderful (and sad) example what happens to even the best intentions when a publicly traded company stops hitting their growth numbers.
