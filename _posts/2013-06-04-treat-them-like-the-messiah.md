title: Treat them like the Messiah
---
After [yesterday's post about hiring](http://theheretic.me/2013/06/03/employee-number-one/) I received an email from one of our fellow Heretics asking me:

"What makes you a founder/co-founder? I work in a startup, I have shares in the company, I was there ever since the actual work started (not in the ideation & research phase). I see myself as a co-founder, but my partners have issues acknowledging this. So I was wondering, what is that makes you a co-founder, if there is such a thing."

**WHAT THE HECK?!**

There is no such thing as a founder, co-founder or anything else. You are all sitting in the same boat, you are all working on the same goals, you are all drowning and desperately trying to stay alive.

**You are one team. Treat each other like the messiah – as all you have is each other.**

If you want to have a big title – go and work for a big company. There is no room for ego in a startup. :)
