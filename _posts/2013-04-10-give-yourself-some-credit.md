title: Give yourself some credit
---
You know that entrepreneur who downplays her startup by telling you that it's really small and has no funding? I meet her all the time.

Give yourself some credit.

Even if you don't have any investment in your company; even if haven't incorporated; even if what you're doing is that little thing on the side â€“ you invest(ed) time and effort. And that's worth something.

You could have spent the time working on something which pays a salary. You could have spent the time drinking beer with your friends. And instead you chose to work on your thing.

Give yourself some credit: You're doing awesome!
