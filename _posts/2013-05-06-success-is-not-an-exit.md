title: Success is not an Exit
---
I recently read the following line in an interview with Wendy Lea, CEO of Get Satisfaction:

"Success is not an exit. That's Silicon Valley talk. Success is building and bringing value every day. The obsession on just the exit, the money, makes me sad."

There is nothing I can add to this.

Build something meaningful. Create something better than the status quo. Do it because you love it. Make people's lives better. And all will be fine.
