A little while ago, when I was about to go on stage for the final rehearsal of my TED talk, a fellow speaker asked me: _“What’s your superpower?”_

That innocuous question, asked more as a conversation starter than a real inquiry, put me on a long, windy path towards figuring out what my purpose in life is.

As Jane [mentioned earlier](http://theheretic.me/2013/12/20/finding-your-purpose/) - I fell into the very trap of trying to figure out what I should be doing instead of asking myself “Who am I being?” For a long time I felt stuck. I had a sentence which I used, it sounded okay but it never felt 100% right.

Then something shifted for me: In coaching the centerpiece of our interaction with the coachee is that we hold people [naturally creative, resourceful and whole](http://www.thecoaches.com/blog/2010/05/people-are-naturally-creative-resourceful-and-whole/). There is nothing to fix; and everything you need is already in you. In all my interactions as a mentor, coach or simply as someone giving advise - this is what I always hold true and believe deeply (even before my coaching training put words around it).

Which brings me back to my own life purpose and my unique superpower: More than anything _I hold the space for you and make you believe what you need to believe to be the superstar you already are._ That’s what I always did and that’s what I always do.

**You are all born with superpowers - you just need to believe!**

With that being said - Put [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB9hJ8ZDAU4) on your playlist (careful - NSFW!) and be a freakin’ superman (and woman!)

**Happy Holidays my fellow Heretics!**
