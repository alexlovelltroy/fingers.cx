title: There is no "Try" but you can experiment
---
> Do.  Or do not. There is no "Try".
> Yoda

Yoda's wisdom is excellent especially when you paraphrase it, "Trying looks the
same as failing."

Don't try to grow your users or improve your product by throwing up ideas and
seeing what sticks.  Choose a path.  Be aware that it could be the wrong path,
but stick to it.  Know what the end should looks like.  Plan not only to
reevaluate, but  plan how to reevaluate.  If the path is going to take longer
than your runway, it's still the wrong path. 

Experimentation is the opposite of trying.  An experiment falls in the "DO"
column for Yoda.  It's marching with purpose and without hesitation.
