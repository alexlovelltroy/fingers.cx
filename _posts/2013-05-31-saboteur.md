We all have a saboteur. The little (and sometimes big) voice in our heads which tells us that we can't do this, we're not good enough, we're not qualified enoughâ€¦

I know that I have one. And not only one.

Identify yours. Find out what he's saying to you. Acknowledge him. Then move on and ignore that sucker.

**Don't doubt. We believe in you.**
