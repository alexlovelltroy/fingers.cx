title: What to look for in an Advisor
---
In a reaction to my post on "[Advisor Compensation](http://theheretic.me/2013/05/17/advisor-compensation/)" one of our fellow Heretics asked me what he should look for in an advisor and/or board member in the first place.

Simple answer. Value.

An advisor (the same is true for board members) has to add value to your organization. And with value I mean **real** value. Too often I see advisory boards sprinkled with the most random of people where it's pretty unclear how they add value. I really don't care how awesome you think uncle Karl is - just because he's a long-time friend of the family and used to have a lemonade stand as a kid just doesn't cut it.

So if killer lemonade stand running skills don't count towards the value score, what are we looking for? A network in your industry and experience of running a business (ideally in your industry). That's pretty much it. Some would argue that being famous also helps â€“ it adds social proof to your organization.

Surround yourself with awesome people who can and want to really  help you. In my experience it can often make the difference between #win and #fail.
