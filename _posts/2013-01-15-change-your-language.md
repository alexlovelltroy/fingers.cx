title: Change your Language
---
This is from a fascinating Wall Street Journal article I read a while ago titled "[Are You As Busy As You Think?](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203358704577237603853394654.html)"

> Instead of saying "I don't have time" try saying "it's not a priority," and see how that feels. Often, that's a perfectly adequate explanation. I have time to iron my sheets, I just don't want to. But other things are harder. Try it: "I'm not going to edit your résumé, sweetie, because it's not a priority." "I don't go to the doctor because my health is not a priority." If these phrases don't sit well, that's the point. Changing our language reminds us that time is a choice. If we don't like how we're spending an hour, we can choose differently."

Made me think quite a bit and consider the language I choose more carefully.
