title: Entrepreneurship is a Craft
---
Investors love to invest into serial entrepreneurs. The believe is that if you've done "it" multiple times (and ideally were successful) you know what you're doing.

In a lot of ways entrepreneurship is a craft. A skill. Something you have to (and can) learn. Mastery which gets better with increased practice.

If you believe in this premise (and I do) – you should find a master and turn yourself into an apprentice entrepreneur.

I was incredibly lucky – having grown up in a household where my dad had his own little company and during college working for one of the most hands-on entrepreneurs I've ever met (Archibald Horlitz, founder of the German Apple retail chain GRAVIS). I owe a lot to these two people.

Find a master and become an apprentice in the art of starting, building and running a business. Soon you will be a master yourself.
