title: Always Be Asking
---
This week a friend of mine - serial entrepreneur, super successful, massively well connected and incredibly smart - met with me for lunch. He told me that he’s writing a book and that he needs my help writing it; that he wants to bounce off ideas and hear my thoughts.

I was pretty surprised. He’s clearly smarter than I am. He has spent significantly more time thinking about the topic he’s writing about than I did. He pretty much knows everyone - which includes a good chunk of people who I would consider much better versed in the topic than I am.

So I asked.

Turns out that my friend does what everyone of us should do all the time: He realized that by collaborating with people, discussing his ideas, throwing stuff out there and seeing what sticks and by deeply listening to what others have to say - his own ideas become stronger and stronger. He sees connections he couldn’t see before. He learns about nuances which he would have not known or dismissed.

**Put yourself and your ideas out there. Ask and talk to as many people as you can - it will make your ideas better, your project stronger and you smarter.**
