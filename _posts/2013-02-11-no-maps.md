There are no maps.

Actually that's not true.

There are maps. They are just not yours.

Realize that whatever someone tells you, whatever you read, whatever the advice is you get in life (and this includes the words yours truly dishes out) - it is always **their** map, not yours.

So take all the information, all the opinions and all the advice and create your own version of reality out of it. **Create your own map.**
