title: Don't compare yourself to others
---
You are not Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg or any other poster child entrepreneur. And that's okay.

We all start out in different places, and everyone's journey is unique. Drawing comparison is a complete waste of time.

Just be yourself. You're doing great.
