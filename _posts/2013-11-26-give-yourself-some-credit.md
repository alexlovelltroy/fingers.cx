title: Give Yourself Some Credit
---
I can not begin to tell you how often I run into absolutely amazing people doing just incredible things who don't give themselves enough credit.

**STOP THIS SHIT!**

You are amazing. You do important work and you do it brilliantly.

Give yourself some credit – and when someone gives you a compliment do yourself a favor and hold your breath, don't just shrug it off but receive it. Receive it because you deserve it.

Seriously: I know a whole bunch of people on this mailing list. And I know that you are fantastic. Allow yourself to know that. It will make you better people.
