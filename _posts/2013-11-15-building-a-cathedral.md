title: Building A Cathedral
---
You know how long it took to build the Empire State Building?

Four hundred and ten days.

It's ironic that it takes most companies longer than that to build and release their product.

Realize that, as a startup, speed is your secret weapon. It's the weapon in your arsenal which allows you to compete with the giants in your field. While they are building cathedrals (which take generations to build), you can build the Empire State Building.

**Go!**
