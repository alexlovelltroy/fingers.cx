title: Are You Waiting For Permission?
---
A coffee conversation today reminded me of an interaction I had with a former boss a while ago. A colleague of mine and I were working on a project and we presented status updates every two weeks to the CEO. After doing so for a while we came to a point where I felt we needed a bit more support from the CEO to push the project forward, get more resources, etc. In the middle of the conversation my CEO said: "What do you want from me? Are you waiting for me to give you permission? If so – it won't happen. You either fight for your project – or you're not ready yet. Nobody will grant you permission."

This interaction stayed with me.

**If it's important you will do whatever you need to do. Regardless.**
