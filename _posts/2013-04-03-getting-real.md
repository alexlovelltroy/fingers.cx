title: Getting Real
---
"Companies get built in the spaces between you, your customers, your investors, your vendors, and your team, where things get gritty and complicated and rarely go according to plan. They don't get built, unfortunately, on a pitch-contest stage."

*~ Eric Schurenberg, Editor Inc. Magazine.*

For the last 30 min I stare at this quote and wreck my brain how to turn it into more of a story. I can't. It's pure and true. I couldn't agree more.

**Get real!** (and have fun doing so)
