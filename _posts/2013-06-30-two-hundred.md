This is my two hundredth Heretic post.

Wow. What a ride!

Thank you all so much for joining me on this journey, for being amazing listeners, critical questioners, incredible marketeers, fantastic entrepreneurs.

The Heretic is a tribe. It is our tribe. We care about our work. We care about the people our work touches. We make things better. We believe in entrepreneurship as the force to do so. We struggle, fear, scramble, hustle and celebrate together. We don't listen to common wisdom and we know that there is no map for us. We blaze our own path.

These are incredibly exciting times – probably the most exciting times since a long, long while. I could not be more excited about the road ahead for each one of you and me personally. Great things will happen. Change is under way. This is just the beginning.

**From the bottom of my heart – Thank you for being part of this. It is an honor and privilege to be part of this.**

P.S. As always – I love hearing from you. What would you like to see more of in The Heretic? What's bothering or annoying you? What was your favorite post? Where would you like us to go?
