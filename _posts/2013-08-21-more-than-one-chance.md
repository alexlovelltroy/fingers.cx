title: More than one Chance
---
A friend of mine, very successful in his career working in the social entrepreneurship-space for a good 15-20 years, confessed to me that he's going back to school. Not to do an MBA or something related to his field of work but to study medicine. He just turned 38. By the time he finishes medical school he will be in his early forties.

Crazy?!

No.

When he leaves school he will still have a good 20+ years to do what he hopefully will love doing.

I found this story incredibly inspiring. How many people do crazy shit like that? And yet – if you think about it: It's not crazy at all. You'll have a lot of chances in life to do what you love doing.

**So… Do that startup of yours. What's holding you back?!**
