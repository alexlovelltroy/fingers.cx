title: Being Thankful (And Learnings from Google)
---
Today is [Thanksgiving](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJd_vm9VhpU) in the US. It's by far my favorite holiday here – as it's all about being thankful, being together with your loved ones and reflecting on the past year.

And: Oh boy – what an amazing year 2013 shaped up to be.

I recently answered the question "How do you like your new gig at [Google Giving](http://google.com/giving/)" with **"I died and woke up in heaven"**. I mean it. Beside all the awesomeness that is Google – the thing which gets me most and which is the reason why I am so happy **and** which is something I believe we Heretics share is: I get to work with some of the most brilliant minds on the planet. People who are doing incredible work, who are top of their game and who are all part of the same tribe. Being in this environment is incredibly inspiring and makes me do my best work.

My friend and fellow Heretic [Kevin Miller](http://superheroexperiments.com/) described being at Google as: "You're sitting in a spaceship and you're looking onto earth."

Which brings me to the bigger point – throughout my life I was happiest and did my best work when I was surrounded by incredibly smart people. People who are top of their game, people who are often much, much smarter than I am. I truly believe that there is nothing better than an environment where you learn something new every single day.

Heretics: Go out, surround yourself with amazing people. Foster your tribe. Find likeminded people who stretch your thinking, who inspire you and who will push you to do **your** best work. You owe it to yourself, to the world – and frankly: it's just more fun that way!

**Happy Thanksgiving tribe. From the bottom of my heart: I am truly thankful for having found you.**
