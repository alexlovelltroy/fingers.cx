title: A Random Note On Failure
---
A little while ago one of our fellow tribespeople pointed something fun out to me: Go to your favorite dictionary and search for "founder".

From the Apple dictionary:

founder |ˈfoundər| verb [ no obj. ]
– (of a ship) fill with water and sink: six drowned when the yacht foundered off the Florida coast.
– (of a plan or undertaking) **fail or break down**, typically as a result of a particular problem or setback: the talks foundered on the issue of reform.
– (of a hoofed animal, esp. a horse or pony) succumb to laminitis.

If you ever had a question about the role of failure in the world of startups, entrepreneurship and founders – now you know. And if you need a little reminder: here's my deck titled "[I HEART FAILURE](https://speakerdeck.com/pfinette/i-3-failure)" which I spoke to at a conference to my fellow German entrepreneurs-in-the-making. :)
