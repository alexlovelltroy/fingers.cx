title: Do The Work
---
This morning I received an email titled "Hustlin' paid off". In it one of our fellow Heretics sent me a link to a picture which symbolized that he did it: He envisioned, created and built his company â€“ and made it work.

I couldn't be more happy for him. This is what it's all about. Putting yourself out there and making it work.

He closed his email with the following comment: "The '[Do The Work](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/do-the-work/)' book changed my life."

A long time ago I gave him a copy of the book. Since then I must have given this book to literally hundreds of people. It's the bible for every Heretic.

**Go, get it and read it. Build something. Read it again. Build some more. Do The Work.**
