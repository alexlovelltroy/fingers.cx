## Who am I am and why do I write with my fingers crossed

Hi,  I'm Alex.

I'm a programmer and lately answer to the title of "Cloud Engineer".  Since
2010, I've been involved in Social Entrepreneurship.  First, it was as a
consultant on digital strategy, but I keep getting more involved through
mentoring and have gone so far as to co-found [Intros](https://intros.to).

I've worked with enough startups at this point to find that I repeat myself.
And, I don't get enough opportunity to write with an audience in mind.  So,
this is my record of the advice I find myself giving more than once, and that
people find useful.  Inspired by the excellent [Pascal Finette](http://finette.com) and his heretical newsletter, [The Heretic](http://theheretic.me), I've decided to make the record public and invite comments and questions.  

Still, I'm writing this all with my fingers crossed.  I **hope** it's
valuable to you.  I **want** to be helpful.  But, until I hear that it's
working for you, I can't know.  That's what sharing with the world is all about.  

### Throw your work over the wall with your fingers crossed and hope someone sends something back.
