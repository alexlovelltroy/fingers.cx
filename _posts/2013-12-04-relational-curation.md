title: Relational Curation
---
By now we should all know how important our network is. And it's not about the size of our network but about the quality of our relationships – this is not a game of "who collected the most contacts" but "who cultivated genuine, meaningful relationships with a group of awesome people".

To that end – try a bit of relational curation: Whenever you have 15 minutes (in a cab, at the airport, at a restaurant waiting for a friend to show up) reach out to someone in your network, send them an interesting article you found, share a relevant thought or introduce them to someone else in your network.

**Cultivate your network. You are who you know.**
