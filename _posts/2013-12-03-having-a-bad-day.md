title: Having A Bad Day?
---
Sometimes your day doesn't quite work out the way you intended to. Over the last three days I had entrepreneurs being annoyed, angry and outright depressed over a "bad day".

I get it.

It's freaking annoying when you lose a day doing stupid things, when stuff breaks left and right and you feel you have achieved nothing by the end of the day. And yet – it happens.

Accept it as a fact of life. As long as it's just the occasional day – it doesn't matter. Really.

Pour yourself a glass of wine, shut down your computer, reflect on the things which went well and the ones which didn't. Follow Kevin's advice on "[making life awesome](http://superheroexperiment.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/make-life-awesome/)" and if that doesn't help:

**Fuck it. Tomorrow is a new day.**
