title: A Heretic Offer
---
Today I've got a personal offer from our fellow Heretic and my dear former Mozilla colleague Matej Novak for all of us:

/////
Heretics,

You may know me as a copywriter, but I'm also currently learning some speaker coaching and training techniques. Specifically, I'm learning to use a tool that helps organize your thinking before putting together a deck. And I need practice.

If you're working on a presentation, I'd love to help. What I'm offering is an hour of my time to talk through your subject and help give it clarity and structure. I'll also be looking for a little feedback, but the majority of the session will be focused on you.

Right now, this offer is open to the first 5 people who respond. (I'm not going to be super strict about that, but if there's a lot of interest, we'll have to work on a schedule so I can get to everyone.)

Please let me know if you'd like any more information. Otherwise, feel free to get in touch: [matejnovak@gmail.com](mailto:matejnovak@gmail.com)

Looking forward to working with you!

Matej

Matej is awesome - I would take him up on it. And check out our [network](http://theheretic.me/network/) which is now than 100 people strong!

We resume normal content programming tomorrow. :)
