title: This is the best shot you ever got
---
I finally got around watching [PRESSPAUSEPLAY](http://www.presspauseplay.com/) (which you should watch too - it's incredible!). In it Seth Godin states in the last shot of the film: "**This is the best shot you ever got.**"

There is nothing I can add to that. Create something now. There is no better time. There is no excuse to not do it.

Dream, think and act big. Take risks. In retrospect and with hindsight you will always beat yourself up for not daring â€“ never for doing something outrageously ambitious.

**This is the best shot you ever got.**
