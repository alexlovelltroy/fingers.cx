## You already know what to do

Everyone I trust for good advice has their own way of telling me to trust myself.  It's fantastic advice and you should all do that too.

...

It's harder than it sounds, isn't it?  Some decisions are just hard.  When you're faced with a choice between financial security for your family or time with them, your gut is going to give you an ulcer.  Your gut is going to reject the question and tell you to have an antacid.

The thing is, you're not going to get better advice.  When you're alone with your thoughts, decide or go seek more information.  Talk to your support system, [the whole thing](/2014/02/26/your-support-system/), and then do a gut check.  Some time talking about the issue and asking for advice is going to help.  But you've got to make your decision for your own reasons.  You have to stop with external input and go internal.

Making that decision means letting go of one option and embracing the other.  Holding on to two incompatible options is just going to give you a stomach ache.

Free yourself and trust your gut.
