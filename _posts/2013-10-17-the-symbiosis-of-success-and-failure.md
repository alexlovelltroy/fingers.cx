title: The Symbiosis Of Success And Failure
---
Last night, while reading a book which Jane had previously devoured (and marked with a text marker in the process), I stumbled upon a quote by Winston Churchill:

_"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."_

I could not agree more. Time and time again success is born out of a string of failures. Even successes which look, with hindsight, as clear, obvious and immediate often have their foundation in failure.

The ability to move from failure to failure, learn, iterate, not being afraid to cut losses early & quickly and keeping the enthusiasm alive whilst the world conspires against her makes the difference between an entrepreneur and a _great_ entrepreneur.

**Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.**

Not much more to say. Keep up your enthusiasm fellow Heretics!
