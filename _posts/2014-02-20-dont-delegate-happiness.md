title: Don't delegate your happiness
---
> When surrounded by unhappy people, it's hard to remain focused on the things that thrill you in life.  Don't let it stop you.

In an organization of any reasonable size, there's going to be some managers that inspire and some that don't.  When you're dealing with a dud, that doesn't give you an excuse to be unhappy.  

Tomorrow is a new day that you can approach with joy and hope.  There are only two ways out of a bad  situation: find your own joy, or find the door.

It's good to remember that as a manager too.  You may not think you're a dud. And, you may not think you're a dud.  But if your team is voting with their feet, you need to figure out how to turn it around.  Your team members are responsible for their own happiness. Bad management practices mean that they'll find it elsewhere.
