title: You can't delegate your happiness
---
> When surrounded by unhappy people, it's hard to remain focused on the things that thrill you in life.  Don't let it stop you.

Happiness within organizations works both ways. Managers aren't responsible for the happiness of their teams.  But, unhappy people are less productive and if they continue to be unhappy, they're likely to vote with their feet.  At the same time, when dealing with a dud of a manager, workers don't get to blame them.  It's the worker, not the manager that approaches the day with dread.  It's the worker, not the manager who brings stress home at night.

When you're unhappy, deal with it.  Face the situation and find a path to happiness.  As a manager, you can't walk that path for your team members, but it is your responsibility to clear paths for them.
