title: Do What's Meaningful To You
---
Time and time again I am part of, get dragged into or overhear conversation where one party tries to instill their values and believes in the other party. Entrepreneurs who are ashamed to say that they are not in it for the money but because they want to make the world a better place. Founders who have a deep desire to make money and feel they can't express this as they would be seen as being superficial. Advisors who argue one way or the other â€“ trying to force their point of view onto their mentee.

Ignore those voices. If you try to please others you will either live your life in misery (as you're faking it) or you will just not be successful. The entrepreneur who fakes his desire to have a quick exit will crumble under the pressure his investors will eventually put on him to get to that exit he promised when he raised capital.

Do what's meaningful to you. Do it for the right reasons (and only you can judge what the right or wrong reasons are).

Just do something meaningful. For you.
