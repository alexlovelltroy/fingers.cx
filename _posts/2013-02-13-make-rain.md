title: Make Rain
---
I am a firm believer in serendipity. Put yourself out there, meet as many people as you can, offer your help without an expectation of any return, be a generally good person. And you will create your own luck (yes - you need to be smart enough to know when you're lucky too).

Point in case: I never interviewed for a single job in my life. They all came to me through friends of friends (and sometimes their friends) whom I met randomly in my past. Serendipity.

The same goes for pretty much every opportunity which came my way. You create your own luck. **You make rain.**

Here's my challenge for you: Go out into the world, meet a random person and ask what you can do for them. Repeat. And repeat. Start today.

I guarantee you that before you know the world will return the favor and you will make rain.
