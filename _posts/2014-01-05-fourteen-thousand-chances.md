title: Fourteen Thousand Chances
---
The average life expectancy in the developed world is somewhere around 78 to 80 years. That means that I will have about 14,000 chances to wake up in the morning and leave my mark on this planet. For those of you who are in your twenties that number is somewhere around 20,000.

Fourteen thousand is a fairly large number. But it's not that big. Surely not big enough to piss away a good number of those chances.

**So - what are you going to do about it?**

P.S. On that topic - if you're a young professional high potential women you should take Jane up on [her offer for essentially free coaching](http://blog.janefinette.com/post/72342259647/the-coaching-fellowship-program-2014-invitation-to). It will change your life.
