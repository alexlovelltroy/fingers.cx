Dear fellow Heretics,

I'll be offline for a week chasing the aurora borealis in Iceland. For once I will try hard not to check email, read any online news and thus will also not publish any musings.

The Heretic turned out to be way more fun than I ever imagined. I mentioned before that I started this as an experiment – I launched this newsletter out of a desire to find an outlet which was more meaningful than Twitter and more intimate than my blog. I thought I will send an email twice a week or so. Well… We're publishing essentially daily, this email marks the 85th Heretic and we're on this journey together for the last 3 months.

And this is only the beginning. As some of you know I do a lot of mentoring, both for startups and individuals. I am currently working on turning this into a proper program which we'll launch under the moniker of **The Mighty Integral** (extra-kudos if you know where the name comes from :)). It will be the anti-incubator. A program which embodies everything The Heretic stands for: Building no-nonsense kick-ass startups which focus on product and customers. Stay tuned.

And in the meantime: Keep sending me feedback, ideas, suggestions and your questions. And if you find yourself in the need for some reading – check out the [archive](http://theheretic.me/archive/). Lots of fun stuff in there.

Talk to you all soon!
