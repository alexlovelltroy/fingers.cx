title: In the long run...
---
While going through a bunch of my "starred" tweets I came across [a tweet](https://twitter.com/johnolilly/status/119397117348429825) from John Lilly, Mozilla's former CEO and now a partner at VC firm Greylock:

> "So my advice to a bunch of folks lately is to remember that life is long, careers are long. We'll all be doing this together a while."

I couldn't agree more. This is so true for the people you work with, the people you surround yourself with and the people you choose to invest into your company.

Consider the longevity of your relationships when you enter into them. Be picky. And then invest into building them.

Or as John Maynard Keynes said: "In the long run we're all dead." ;)
