- Mobile subscriptions: 6.8 billion versus 7.1 billion people worldwide - more than 1/2 in Asia Pacific (3.5 billion)

- People online: 2.7 billion - almost 40% of the world's population
- Households Online: 750 million or 41% globally (78% in developed countries, 28% in developing)
- Population Online by Country Status: 31% in developing countries, 77% in developed countries
- Regional Internet penetration: Europe highest at 75%, Africa lowest at 15% (only half that of Asia Pacific)
- Mobile Broadband Subscription Penetration: Europe (68%), Americas (48%), CIS (46%), Asia Pacific (22%), Arab States (19%), Africa (11%)
