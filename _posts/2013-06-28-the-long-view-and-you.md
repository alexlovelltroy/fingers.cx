title: The Long View and You
---
Yesterday we talked about how taking the [long view on your organization](http://theheretic.me/2013/06/27/the-long-view/) can fundamentally change everything.

A few days ago I sat down with one of Mozilla's brilliant interns who asked me if I think he should work at a startup after graduating from college. The answer is obviously **yes**. I also provided him with a different lens to view ones career which happens to also be a long term view:

When you start out your career you have about 40-45 years in the workforce ahead of you (assuming you start at about 20 years young and retire by the age of 65). Throughout my career I probably averaged three years at a single job – after that I get bored and need to do something else. This means that, throughout my career, I'll have a good 15 shots at doing something new. **Fifteen opportunities!**

Now – how much would it matter if one, two, three or even five of these shots turn out to be the wrong thing? Not at all.

So – go for that startup. Or whatever else it is you want to do. You have a ton of opportunities left in your life.
