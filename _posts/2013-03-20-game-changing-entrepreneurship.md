title: Game Changing Entrepreneurship
---
Scott Cook, founder of financial software giant Intuit and one of the most thoughtful leaders in the industry, recently spoke about his approach to innovation at the SxSW conference.

His approach to, what he calls, game changing entrepreneurship is spot on and one of the most concise ways to describe it I've seen so far:

The focus on finding an important and unsolved customer problem stands in an interesting contrast to what a lot of startups do these days: They start with an idea or technology and try to either find a market or create a market.

Idea first vs problem first.

Guess which approach is more reliably successful?
