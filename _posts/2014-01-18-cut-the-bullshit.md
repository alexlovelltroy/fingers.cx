title: Cut The Bullshit
---
It is remarkable how many people (and managers in particular) seem to be stuck in the paradigm of sugarcoating: Instead of giving people straight, direct and honest feedback they use techniques such as "the sandwich" (deliver some good news at the beginning of the conversation, put the bad news into the middle and end with some good news), "the cake" (pretend that it's all fine by bringing something completely unrelated but positive to the discussion) or simply avoiding the discussion altogether.

Here's the deal: The only way to hold the other person naturally creative, resourceful and whole (i.e. not treat them like a child) is to deliver the truth without any fluff and coming from a place of empathy and compassion.

**In a nutshell: Speak the truth and don't be an asshole.**
