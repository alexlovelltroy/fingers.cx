title: Excellence Takes Practice
---
Yesterday my wonderful wife [Jane](http://janefinette.com/) reminded me of an important lesson: Excellence takes practice.

The next time you find yourself banging your head against a wall, believing that you will never be great at what you're doing, think of the wise words of the Greek philosopher Aristotles: 

"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit."

Practice, practice some more and trust in the process.
