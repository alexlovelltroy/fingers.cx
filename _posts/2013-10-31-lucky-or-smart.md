title: Lucky Or Smart

We talk a lot about rainmaking here at The Heretic HQ – Heretics share a believe that we are the masters of your own destiny, that we shape the outcomes we want and that the future is uncertain (which we celebrate as a good thing).

And yet – there is something important to understand:

**You have to be smart enough to realize when you're lucky.**

When luck strikes you need to be able to recognize it, have the chutzpah to follow the lead and make it happen. Trust me – I have missed so many amazing opportunities by not recognizing when luck struck me; it's not even funny.

With that being said I often get asked: When do you know that luck is about to strike?

I thought about this a lot and the best I can offer you is: **Trust your gut and follow your heart.** Every single time luck was about to hit me and I failed to act upon it, I knew deep down that I should take the opportunity.
