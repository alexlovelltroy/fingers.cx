title: It's better to be smart than clever
---
People are ingenious about automating the parts of their job that they find
repetitive or boring.  We have canned responses in gmail and tools like
TextExpander which can turn a few letters into a full paragraph.  But, no one
is as clever at building small time-savers as the System Administrators that
keep all the servers on the internet running.

I started out as one of those clever Sysadmins.  In the beginning of my career,
I was responsible for managing several dozen servers all by myself.  They
shared a lot of the same services, so I wrote the smallest possible program to
run the same set of commands on all servers and check the results.  My
co-worker, "Jane" at the time was managing a different set of similar computers.  She
didn't do what I did.  Instead, she spent 15 minutes each morning logging in to
each server and checking on things.

> WIN!  I've got an extra 15 minutes each day

Flash forward about a month when new services needed to be added, Jane's daily 15
minutes didn't change, but I spent half a day adapting my scripts and then
another half day cleaning up when things didn't work the way I planned.

> FAIL! I've lost so much time.

Even worse, when I picked up another group of computers, I had to start all
over with new scripts, but Jane just added another 15 minute window to her day.
When it was time for one of us to pick up a massive group of computers, our
boss picked Jane because she was too smart to think she was clever. With
hundreds of machines, Jane spent a week writing some management software based
on everything she had learned in those daily 15 minute server-checks.

Smart, Jane.  Very, Very Smart.
