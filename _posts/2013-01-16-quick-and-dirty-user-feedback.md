title: Quick and Dirty User Feedback
---
Here's a quick way to get user feedback (and getting user feedback early and often is top of mind for you, right?). We use this at Mozilla all the time.

Take your prototype (or whatever you want to test), walk into the next Starbucks and pick a random person. Offer to pay for their coffee in exchange for 5 minutes of their time.

Try it out. It's incredible how much interesting feedback you can get for the price of a cup of coffee.
