title: Make Life Awesome

Today I want to encourage you to read this wonderful blog post by Kevin Miller:

[Superhero Experiment: Make Life Awesome.](http://superheroexperiment.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/make-life-awesome/)

Kevin is an incredible person - I first met him at the Unreasonable Institute where he interned for the summer and was assigned my "partner in crime". We spent hours running together alongside the creek in Boulder, CO - talking about anything and everything. Today I am privileged to mentor him - and be inspired by his passion, drive and genuine enthusiasm for life.

We need more Kevins in this world. Be one.
