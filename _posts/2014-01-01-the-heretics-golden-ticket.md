title: The Heretic's Golden Ticket
---
The Heretic tribe is incredibly generous - you rallied around the [Heretic Network](theheretic.me/network/) and from all I can tell it's a huge success already. You jumped at the chance to network in our new [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/theheretic/) and already started helping each other out in a very real and meaningful way.

**Now let's try something else: [The Heretic's Golden Ticket.](http://theheretic.me/goldenticket/)**

I want to create a goodie bag full of awesome stuff which helps us do our jobs better, learn more, be more productive and safe some money in the process.

We start with a free copy of Ash Maurya's excellent book "Running Lean", courtesy of a deal I made with Ash when we built Mozilla's accelerator program WebFWD. If you happen to have something you want to offer to our fellow Heretics - send me an email.

_Please note that it must be a real and genuine offer - give away something for free which you would normally charge for or, if that's not possible, give a meaningful rebate. Pay it forward and be generous._

**I am so thrilled to see what we can do with The Heretic in 2014. One thing's for sure: It's going to be awesome. Happy 2014 everyone!**
