I thought about writing another rant today. But you know what? I am actually an eternal optimist. So let's stop ranting for a day (although - it is fun, I have to admit) and tell you about my most favorite book.

The one book which I literally bought dozens of copies of and gave away to friends. It's Steven Pressfield's [Do the Work](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/do-the-work/). It's a shorter and more to the point version of his amazing book The Art of War. It talks about resistance and how to overcome it. It's a must read. I've given it to people who read it on their plane trip back from meeting with me (it's a quick read) and were in tears. Literally. And then they went and did what they put off for way to long.

Do yourself a favor. Read it. Seriously.

And let me know what you think.

P.S. I just saw that Amazon sells the Hardcover for $5. Woo! Go, buy now!
