title: Premature Optimization
---
Last night I spent about three hours working on a logo for one of Jane's new projects. A good chunk of that time was devoted to getting the kerning of the logo type just right.

A classic example of premature optimization.

I would have been much better off spending at least two of those three hours working on the content, the website structure or any number of things.

Premature optimization is a tricky little bitch - it can be so much fun, so rewarding ("See how much better the logo type looks with that little kerning twist!?") and yet so superfluous.

Focus on the important things, build, launch, iterate - then (and only then) optimize.

P.S. Talking about which - one of our wonderful Heretics has a fantastic offer for you: _Introducing WHAT'S NEXT. [The Found](http://thefound.org/) is offering free 30-minute sessions for six people or businesses in the Heretic Network who want to make a big, quick step in the right direction for their projects and ventures. By putting one goal into the [Cycle of Manifestation](http://thefound.org/blog/on-making-things-happen), together we will decide on the best thing for you to do tomorrow when you wake up!
