title: A Personal Update
---
Just want to share this with my Heretic tribe – Yesterday I sent the following email to my dear colleagues at Mozilla:

**Subject: So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish // A Personal Update**

Dear Friends,

After five wonderful years at [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/video/?video=brand) the time has come for me to leave the [mothership](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y), follow my calling and [dance in the moment](http://zeega.com/150647) by combining my passions for entrepreneurship, technology and global impact.

It has been an incredible time, a great adventure and an unforgettable journey. From the bottom of my heart I want to thank all of you for making, keeping and continuously evolving Mozilla – a truly [unique place](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/video/?video=whatismozilla).

I am eternally grateful to have had the chance to work with and more importantly learn from some of the most inspiring, most passionate and smartest people in the industry, including the original Labs team ([Anant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T84_kZeoLY), [Atul](http://vimeo.com/2604372), [Aza](http://vimeo.com/5483375), [Ben A](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0USgAawpg), [Ben G and Dion A](http://vimeo.com/3195079) (they only come in a pair), [Brian](http://vimeo.com/27177893), [Dan M](http://vimeo.com/2569344), [Dan W](http://www.directorypatent.com/US/07739604.html), [Ed](http://www.webmonkey.com/2011/04/awesomebar-hd-packs-more-awesomeness-into-firefox/), [Jinghua](http://vimeo.com/12373225), [Joe](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gen/4776811766/in/photostream/), [Jono](http://vimeo.com/2974320), [Kevin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sM_xG3Hl0_w), [Lloyd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBFVrmyald4), [Mike](http://vimeo.com/12092555), [Myk](http://vimeo.com/2756134), [Ragavan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv96VuMQvj0), [Sean](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nitot/4786445371/in/photosof-mart3ll/), [Suneel](http://vimeo.com/2832032), [Toby](http://tobyelliott.wordpress.com/), [Zandr](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xc2lQdGFQ0)), the incredible WebFWD crew ([Diane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO8jAUUHD90) & [Didem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6pu8nY7zBY)), the [Identity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIFvKVJ6vk4) gang (sorry guys - you're too many to list) and the awesome [#MozSummit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh-TxzPaNzI) crew (you know who you are! #amazing #hashtag #<3).

_Thank you. You make this place special._

In addition to working with these wicked smart people I must have won the boss-lottery – having had four of the most amazing people as my bosses: [Chris](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgGPJAf_rlQ), [John](http://wordpress.tv/2009/07/08/john-lilly-mozilla/), [Todd](http://www.viddler.com/v/3ecee4e1) and [Mitchell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjHEfhVnIxo).

_Thank you. You believed in me and taught me so, so much._

Not to forget my fellow [LEADers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPOgvzVOQig) from [cohort](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NP8y63Ms4o) [one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY) and [Athena](http://ideatribe.com/tribe/athena.htm) & [Kate](http://ideatribe.com/tribe/kate.htm).

_I love you guys! You made me grow._

And it's not only the people I worked with directly – it's all of you.

**You are just incredible!**

And yet – as so often in life: Good things have come to an end eventually. So let me leave you with a quote from [Alan Watts](http://zeega.com/152820) – may it serve you well on your journey:

_"The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it and join the dance."_

**So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish!**

Oh - and as someone much wiser than I said before: “[Farewell, but not goodbye!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRL5Z1k60tg)” I am working with Mitchell and others on very concrete ways to [stay involved](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/). More on that soon.

With deep admiration,

P.S. I will stay around for a tiny bit longer - my last day in the office will be Thursday, Oct 31st when I will leave for a short trip during which I will be available on email and phone. Officially my last day will be Friday, November 8th.

P.P.S. If the suspension is about to kill you and you just need to know what I will be doing next… [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).
