title: There Is No Try
---
New Year's Eve Jane and I watched all three episodes of Star Wars in one go (before you ask - I deny the existence of Star Wars I, II and III). It was a blast. In Episode V the following dialog takes place:

_Luke: All right, I'll give it a try._
_Yoda: No. Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try._

This is the decision we are faced with every single day: Do... or do not. And too many of our contemporaries choose the easy way out: They tell themselves that they just try and only dip one toe into the water. As much as this might be a risk-avoiding strategy - it's a cop-out. You're selling yourself short.

**If you really want something - there is no try. Do. Or do not. But make a decision.**
