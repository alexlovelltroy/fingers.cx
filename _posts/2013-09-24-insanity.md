title: Insanity
---
A book I am reading at the moment about global poverty and how entrepreneurship could be a highly effective remedy, reminded me of a great Albert Einstein quote: "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."

Funny, eh? Sadly I know way to many people who do things which are insane under this definition (yours truly included).

Probably time to stop and reflect for a bit. If you find doing similar or even the same thing over and over again (say you're pitching investors with the same pitch and hear "no" all the time) it might be wise to stop doing what you're doing, reassess, refine and try a different approach.

Just a thoughtâ€¦
