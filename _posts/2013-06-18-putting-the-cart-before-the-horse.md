title: Putting The Cart Before The Horse
---
Every once in a while I meet an entrepreneur who has the whole "build a company"-thing backwards: They start with the goal of selling their company and then try to fill in the blanks. That's putting the cart before the horse â€“ it's incredibly hard to build something which is worth selling (and buying for the other side) if you don't pour all your energy and focus into creating lasting customer value.

There is value in building a company which is ready to be sold should the time come. It forces you into a mode of thinking and operational excellence which pays off even if you never intend to sell your company. But you have to start by creating something customers genuinely want and find useful.

**No customer value, no company value. Simple as that.**
