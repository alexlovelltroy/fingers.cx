title: Make this your motto for 2013
---
Do you have a job title which reads anything else but founder or CEO? If so - make this your motto for 2013:

> "Our job titles are designed to empower us, not to limit us! Put your business card on the desk in front of you...This card does not define you. You are a Co-President. You are bigger than your defined role, and you are much more than your job title. Play your partâ€”transcend your job title, be a hero."

(from an [article](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201212/issie-lapowsky/the-nerdery-mike-derheim-everyone-at-my-company-has-one-job-title.html) in the December edition of Inc. magazine)
