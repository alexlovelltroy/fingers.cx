title: Make this your motto for 2013
---
Do you have a job title which reads anything else but founder or CEO? If so - make this your motto for 2013:

> **"Our job titles are designed to empower us, not to limit us! Put your business card on the desk in front of you...This card does not define you. You are a Co-President. You are bigger than your defined role, and you are much more than your job title. Play your partâ€”transcend your job title, be a hero."**
