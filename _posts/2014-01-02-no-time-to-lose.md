title: No Time To Lose
---
One of the highlights and true perks which come with The Heretic is the fact that I get to speak to a whole bunch of you - on the phone, in video chats and in real life. One thing which continually blows me away is how many Heretics are in their early twenties (and even younger). Add all the people I meet by being a mentor at the [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/) or the [Unreasonable Institute](http://unreasonableinstitute.org/) and I honestly can say I am in awe.

You guys have no time to lose. You channel your youthful energy into making things better. You want and will change the world. You are the true heroes of your generation.

Keep it up. We need you. And do us all a favor: Instill this spirit in everyone you touch. Infect the world with your boundless energy, your optimism and your disregard for the impossible.

**Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.**
