title: Do you work for the right company?
---
Last Friday I hosted a group of Dutch students at Mozilla. We talked about all things entrepreneurship. At the end of our discussion a student asked me: "So - you're not working in your own startup at the moment and you did work for quite a few companies over the course of your career… How do you know if a company is right for you?"

I love this question.

At its most basic level I suggest you follow the t-shirt test: If you are proud wearing a t-shirt with the company logo in your spare time, over the weekends, while you're out and about – you found a company you believe in. If you rather not wear their logo on your chest – you better leave and find something different.

P.S. I am writing this post while wearing a Mozilla t-shirt by the way…
