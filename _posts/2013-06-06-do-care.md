title: Do Care
---
Last night I bumped into an entrepreneur who made a throw-away comment when I asked him about a detail in the way he runs his startup. He said: "I don't care."

Never ever **ever** don't care.

When you create a startup, when you make something out of nothing, every single detail matters. What you create is equally as important as to how you approach and do it.

I am fine with you telling me that you really couldn't give a damn about fancy furniture or the hours your team works – but make this a conscious decision. Every tiny little decision will make its way into your culture, will influence how your team views the world and how your customers perceive you.

Do care, be conscious and mindful – you *are* your company. **If you don't care – why should we?**
