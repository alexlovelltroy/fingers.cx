title: Inspiring Great Design
---
We all "know" when we experience great design. And we all get annoyed (at best) when we stumble across bad design. Sadly the world is full of bad design and great design is rare. Which makes good design an incredibly powerful differentiator. And thus something you should not only aspire to but actually deliver.

Use the following two questions as starting points to create great design in your product/service:

(1) What are the thoughtless little ways we irritate customers and what can we do to change that?

(2) What are the small, unexpected delights we could deliver to our customers at virtually no additional costs?
