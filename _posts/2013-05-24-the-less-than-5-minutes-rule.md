title: The "Less than 5 Minutes" Rule
---
I consider myself a "giver" â€“ I find it deeply gratifying to help other people. A lot of my friends are givers. Being a giver not only feels good, it also creates room for serendipity.

And I follow the "less than 5 minutes" rule: If doing something for someone else (e.g. an introduction, a quick comment, you name it) takes less than five minutes of my time I will always do it.

Try it out. You not only will feel good about yourself and help others but make our community a bit better with each act of giving.

*P.S. I highly recommend Adam Grant's book "[Give and Take](http://www.giveandtake.com/)" for much more in-depth information on the subject.*
