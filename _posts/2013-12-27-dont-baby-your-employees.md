title: Don't Baby Your Employees
---
One of the more curious facets of how people are being managed is that often companies make decisions for them. Generally this makes sense (employees should not worry about paying the rent for the office building or figuring out which electricity provider to choose) - but often enough we are babying our employees. People whom we trust to spend their salary well and make independent decisions (such as buying a car, renting or buying an apartment or house or planning for a vacation) are being forced to justify every small expense. We tell them which mouse and keyboard to use, we choose their office chair for them and we decide which coffee they have to drink when they are in the office.

Why not just give them a budget and let them choose what's right for them?

Encourage your people to think like owners and trust them. I can pretty much guarantee you that your employees will make better decisions, pick a better chair, mouse and keyboard for themselves and feel better about coming to work every day.
