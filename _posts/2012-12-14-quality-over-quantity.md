title: Quality over Quantity
---
You know all that jazz about quality over quantity. How multi-tasking destroys your productivity and so onâ€¦ A while ago I found this image - courtesy of the one and only Tim Ferris which summarizes the main work principles beautifully:

In summary:

* Check email ONLY:
* 10AM
* 1PM
* 4PM

* Send any time
* Set email to check every 3 hours.
* NO email on evenings.
* NO email on weekends.
* EMERGENCY? = Use phone.

* FOCUS 1-3 Activities max/day
* LOG 1-3 Succinct status bullets every day on team wiki

* MINIMIZE chat
* MAXIMIZE single-tasking

* OUT by 5:30PM ~ No excuses

These simple rules saved my bacon for years now.
