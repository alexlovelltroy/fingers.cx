The single largest factor which keeps you from doing the things you are destined to do isâ€¦ fear.

Plain old fear.

It's crippling. It's terrifying. It doesn't let go.

And it's stupid.

The higher the stakes - the more crippling, the more terrifying your fear becomes.

And you know better. 

**On the field of the self stand a knight and a dragon. You are the knight. Fear is the dragon.**

I have to slay the dragon every single day. Sometimes it's easier, sometimes it's harder. But I make sure that I never ever not kill the beast by the end of the day. As this is the only way you can do what you're meant to do.
