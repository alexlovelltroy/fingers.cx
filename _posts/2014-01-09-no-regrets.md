title: No Regrets
---
Two days ago I had coffee with a dear friend and fellow Heretic. We talked about making those dreaded life choices: Should I start a company? Should I quit my job? Should I join my friend's startup? Should I...?

When you leap into the unknown, when you do something new, when you travel on a road for which you don't have a map - for a lot of us these questions keep coming back again and again.

My friend offered one piece of advice which I can't get out of my head:

"Whatever you do - look at the decision you're about to make and ask yourself the question: Later in life, would you regret not taking the opportunity?"

**Live a life of no regrets.**

And - thank you dude. You made me think.
