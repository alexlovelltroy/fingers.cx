Today I want you to do something for me – head over to the Apple website and [watch this video](http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/).

Regardless of what you think about Apple and if you believe the video speaks truly of Apple – the essence of that video is precisely how you should think about your product.

Only then should you sign your work.
