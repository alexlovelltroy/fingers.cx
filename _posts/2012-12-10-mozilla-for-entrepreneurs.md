title: Mozilla for Entrepreneurs
---
One of the things I truly enjoy doing is walking a group of aspiring entrepreneurs through a session on Mozilla's history and the lessons we learned along the way (which happen to be highly applicable for entrepreneurs as well). Plus I sprinkle a dose of personal war stories into the mix. Heck - some of you have even seen me do this presentation.

For quite a while I used a deck which I created on a flight from SFO to NYC a while ago. [You can check it out here](http://blog.finette.com/2012/04/04/mozilla-for-entrepreneurs/).

This weekend I finally found the time to reflect on the dozens of times I gave that presentation, think about what worked and what didn't and cut down the presentation into the bare essentials (yes - for all you Lean Startupers: a MVP!).
