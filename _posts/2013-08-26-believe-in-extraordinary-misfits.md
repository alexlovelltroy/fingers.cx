title: Believe in Extraordinary Misfits
---
When I started writing the Heretic I chose the title somewhat deliberately as I felt like, well… a heretic in startup land. At least sometimes. And I wanted to write for other misfits who were just like me.

Turns out – there are more of us out there. A lot more. Not only is The Heretic itself a tribe by now (and you are all part of it) but Joseph Logan writes a delightful blog where he introduces another Heretic every Thurday in his column "[Heretic Thursday](http://josephlogan.com/?p=1561)" and will eventually turn this all into a book.

[Go check it out](http://josephlogan.com/) and get your dose of weekly inspiration from other Heretics just like you!
