title: And versus But
---
How many times during the course of a day do you say **but**? I bet you money that it's more than you think. For some obscure reason we are conditioned to string our arguments with **but**. As in: This is great, **but…**

Humor me and try the following: Replace every but with an **and** – as in: This is great, **and…**

See what it does? See how it opens the conversation? See how it makes things possible?

**But** is pure stop energy. It's like running a car into a solid concrete wall. **And** adds energy. It widens the horizon. It facilitates discussion.

**And** is the word of the entrepreneur. **But** is the word of bureaucrats. Who of the two are you?

P.S. Please excuse the irregular schedule - I'm at [Unreasonable at Sea](http://theheretic.me/2013/04/17/unreasonably-excited) at the moment. :)
