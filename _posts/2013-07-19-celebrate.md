<p><em>We've come a long long way together,<br>Through the hard times and the good,<br>I have have to celebrate you baby,<br>I have to praise you like I should</em></p>

Many entrepreneurs have a remarkable tendency to talk down the (little) wins on the way to their envisioned success. Someone told them somewhere sometime ago that "all that counts is the WIN". And so they forget to pause, reflect and celebrate along the way.

That's too bad.

A startup is seldom a straight path. Your road is paved with plenty of obstacles and frequent diversions and detours. Every day brings another struggle and sometimes another little win.

Celebrate those wins. Reflect on them. Each and every one of those brings you closer to the bright light at the end of the tunnel.

And even if you don't do it for yourself â€“ do it for your co-workers. Trust me: They will appreciate it.

Godspeed my dear friends.
