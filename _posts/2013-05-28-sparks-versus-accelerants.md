title: Sparks versus Accelerants
---
I find that there are roughly speaking two types of founders: Sparks and Accelerants.

Sparks are the ideas guys. The ones who come up with stuff. The ones who create something out of nothing.

Accelerants are the people who make things run faster. The ones who take a lump of carbon and cut & polish it into a diamond.

Both are necessary in a startup. Both are valuable. Both have their own set of strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes you find people who are true pyromaniacs and provide both the spark as well as the accelerant.

I am an accelerant. I tend to fail pretty miserable when I put myself into spark mode. And it's fine. Know what you're good at and then get excellent at it.

Spark or Accelerant. Which type are you? And are you playing up to your strengths?
