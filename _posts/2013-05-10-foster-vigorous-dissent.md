title: Foster Vigorous Dissent
---
There is ample (scientific) evidence that organizations which are made up of people from diverse backgrounds and which foster a culture of vigorous dissent fare much better than those which don't; and in pretty much every aspect – from their ability to innovate to the amount of revenue they bring in.

Sadly a lot of organizations seem to run on the principle of a cloned workforce and an inherent need for harmony. This is too bad.

As I've explained in an earlier post: I strongly believe in [brutal intellectual honesty](http://theheretic.me/2013/02/14/brutal-intellectual-honesty/). You have to have the ability to argue, to rip things apart, to hear the voices from an as diverse group of people as possible – only then will you create something superior.

This is your chance to create this environment and create an organization which is a truly amazing living organism and not just a dull version of Disneyland.

**Foster vigorous dissent and practice brutal intellectual honesty.**

P.S. A friend of mine is putting together a [neat event](http://www.capitalonstage.com/) where investors pitch to startups (yes - you read this right). If you happen to be in Berlin and want to go: Get €60 (>45%) discount if you apply for COS Berlin (May 16th) and write "startup bootcamp" in the "referred by" field in your application. [Apply here](https://www.dealmarket.com/pages/public/externalsubmit/cos/cos_externalSubmit_register.seam?accessCode=&mg=176701&externalSubmitKey=uOdLa5YJ81&cid=51081). And no – I don't get paid for this. ;)
