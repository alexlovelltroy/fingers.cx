title: The Art of Being Human
---
For some bizarre reason a lot of people I meet in startup land believe that they have to be perfect. All the time. Can't show a kink in their armor. Everything is always awesome.

**It is not.**

Trust me: We (the people) don't care about emotionless machines. We want the real deal. We want human interactions. Not some self-inflated slick egomaniacs.

When my first startup went down the drain I became depressed. Had to pack my stuff and travel through Nicaragua for 3 months to find myself again. When we moved to London I became uprooted and depressed. I went to therapy.

I talk about these things because they make me who I am.

Allow yourself to be vulnerable. Allow us in. Allow us to build relationships with you. Allow yourself to be human.
