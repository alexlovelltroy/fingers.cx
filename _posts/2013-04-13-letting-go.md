After yesterday's post on being "[Hard and Fair](http://theheretic.me/2013/04/12/hard-and-fair/)" one of our fellow Heretics asked me how this translates into situations where you find yourself working with people who, for one reason or another, just don't work out.

Tough situation. Especially when you are a small team, presumably with personal bonds between team members.

And yet there are a couple of points I feel strongly about: First and foremost – you have to do what's right for the company. You owe it to your idea, you owe it to your customers and you owe it to the other team members. Secondly – you have to do it fast and decisively. Time and speed is often the only advantage you have in a crowded marketplace. Thirdly – follow the "hard and fair" maxim. Letting someone go is always tough and emotional. By acting swiftly, taking the emotions out of it as much as possible and being fair you have the ability to make the experience much less painful for both sides.

Speaking from experience: Having someone around who is poisonous (especially in the early days of a company) can break a company.  Trust your gut: Do what is the right thing to do. And don't wait. It hardly ever gets better with time.
