title: Big Ideas & Elevator Pitches
---
I am sure you have heard the term "elevator pitch" before. The idea is that you step into an elevator with a potential investor, partner or employee and you have all of 30 seconds until the elevator reaches the top floor and the two of you will step out of the elevator and go your respective ways. In those 30 seconds you have to pitch your startup like never before. You need to be succinct, engaging and to the point. It's only 30 seconds after all.

It's a silly concept â€“ but there is something important and powerful in there:

**When you present an entrepreneurial idea, if it takes more than three sentences to explain it to the money guys, it's not a Big Idea!** 

After three sentences of explanation, people's eyes glaze over.

What's your three sentence pitch?
