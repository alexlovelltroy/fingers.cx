title: Ideas are cheap and plentiful
---
The title says it all. One of the defining features of an entrepreneur is her ability to generate ideas. Lots of them. Which is great.

The problem comes when people believe that ideas in itself are worth something. They are cagy, believing that sharing their idea would be akin to giving away the crown jewels.

Ideas are cheap and plentiful.

In the vast majority of cases it all comes down to execution. Gritty, determined, boring execution is where ideas are turned into gold. The team which executes better is the team which wins.

Ideas are getting better when you talk about them. Invite others into the discussion, hear different perspectives, get feedback. It will make your idea so much better.

**Share your ideas liberally. And execute like a pro.**
