title: Ubiquitous Computing
---
I'm just back from the [Citrix Startup Accelerator](http://citrixstartupaccelerator.com/) where I was asked to babel a bit about my view on the future of the Web/computing/tech in general. When I did the research for the talk the one thing which stood out and excites me more than anything else is the emerging field of ubiquitous computing.

Anything from the [Nest thermostat](http://nest.com/) to the incredible [Electric Imp](http://electricimp.com/) platform/kit and the fact that Apple now puts more compute-power and memory into a [cable](http://www.panic.com/blog/2013/03/the-lightning-digital-av-adapter-surprise/) than I had available when I started programming - the future is clearly: Tons and tons of CPUs surrounding you, sensors providing input on pretty much anything and software being the magic glue.

I am giddy with excitement.

The big question is: How do you plan for this future? What will your company look like and do with all this compute power, inputs and new interaction models?
