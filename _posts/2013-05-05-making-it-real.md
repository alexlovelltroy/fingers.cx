title: Making it Real
---
I wrote my [first Heretic post](http://theheretic.me/2012/11/19/so-lets-get-this-party-started/) on November 19th. This is post number 148. In the meantime The Heretic grew into a community of hundreds of entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, startup people, folks who aspire to become an entrepreneur from all around the world. We share a common believe that the onus is on us when it comes to making the world better. We are a tribe. A tribe of Startup Heretics.

Time to make it real.

A little while ago I relaunched the [website](http://theheretic.me/) to be more interactive, to have a proper archive of past posts and to encourage discussion around the posts.

Yesterday we (finally) set up a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/thehereticdotme) – join us there for the discussion, ask your questions and meet your fellow Heretics.

And today I propose an experiment: Over the last couple of months a bunch of you have sent me emails asking for specific advice. Keep doing this – I love to help. And let's take this up a notch: Starting next week I'll offer a **30 min in-person (or Skype/Google Hangout) session each Friday at 9am PST** to talk about anything you want. Simply send me an email to schedule your session. First come, first serve. No strings attached.
