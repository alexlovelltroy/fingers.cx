title: Don't Try To Predict The Future
---
I recently read in a research paper on entrepreneurship:

_"To the extend that we can control the future, we do not need to predict it."_

This is a profound statement – especially when you take into account that the best entrepreneurs usually come from a position of not believing that the future is somewhere "out there" to be discovered, but that it gets created through their very strategies and actions.

Most entrepreneurs I know prefer to be in unpredictable markets; markets that can be shaped by their own decisions and actions – as opposed to compete in predictable (often more mature) markets where they face the uphill battle of fighting with people who might be smarter and better resourced.

**Make no mistake: As an entrepreneur you are in the business of creating the future.**

P.S. Apologies for the slightly off-schedule postings lately. A lot going on here. More on this soon…
