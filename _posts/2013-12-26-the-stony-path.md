title: The Stony Path
---
When you look at [my CV](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pfinette) it's pretty messy. Especially if you would see the unedited and unpolished version of it.

My life is a string of interesting opportunities randomly connected, which presented themselves to me often through sheer luck and which took me to truly interesting and amazing places. I often opted to chose the stony path instead of the easy one - knowing that by challenging myself I would find more fulfillment and have more fun in the process.

**Straight and narrow paths rarely lead to interesting destinations.**

I encourage you, NO - **I urge you** - to find your path, defy conventional wisdom and do what will fulfill and grow you. You owe it to yourself.
