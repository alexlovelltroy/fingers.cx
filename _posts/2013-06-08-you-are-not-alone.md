title: You are not alone…
---
Over the course of the last two weeks I have met a good dozen completely amazing entrepreneurs. Strong, powerful, driven, enthusiastic, smart, focussed, energetic people. And yet nearly each and everyone of them told me that they battle with insecurity. That they doubt themselves. That they feel vulnerable.

Trust me: You're not alone. We all feel like that. It's okay.

Allow yourself to be vulnerable – the world doesn't need emotionless men and women of steel. We need real human beings, people we can connect to and with whom we can emotionally bond.

Just be you. The rest will take care of itself.
