title: People are Dumb (NOT)
---
"My users are dumb" is something I hear way too often, especially from engineer-founders. It's supposed to be tongue in cheek â€“ and yet they often actually mean it.

**If you think people are dumb, you spend a lifetime doing dumb work.**

People are smart. When you start from this position you will end up building better products, create better work, get better results and make a dent.
