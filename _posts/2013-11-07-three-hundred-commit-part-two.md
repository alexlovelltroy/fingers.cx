title: Three Hundred / Commit - Part 2
---
We made it. Together we just crossed the three hundred posts mark for The Heretic! We did so in less than a year (the first email was sent out on November 19th to fewer than twenty people).

To be honest – I had no idea where this would take us. I had no idea that I have 300 posts (and many more to come) in me. I had no idea that The Heretic would become a community of doers, builders and creators – all joint by the fact that we are wonderful misfits, rebels and troublemakers.

And here's the best anniversary present ever – witnessing **your** commitments to the world:

Let me finish this with my own declaration:

Let's change the world. Together.
