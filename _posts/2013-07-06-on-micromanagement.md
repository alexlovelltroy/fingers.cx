title: On Micromanagement
---
One of our fellow Heretics asked me the following question on our Heretic's "[Topics for Tomorrow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AFodj-wcn1oUplocTFMwO1YzqNNHWTAbbcDgy2_1Luo/edit?usp=sharing)" Google Doc:

"What do you think about micromanaging everything?"

**Don't!**

It is your job as a leader to create the vision and set clear direction. Provide all the tools necessary for your team to execute and then get the hell out of their way.

People perform best when they have **autonomy, mastery and purpose**. Autonomy to do what they need to do, mastery of the task at hand and purpose to provide meaning. There is no room for micromanagement.
