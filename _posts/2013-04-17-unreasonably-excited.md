This is a quick service announcement:

Dear Heretics â€“ I will join the incredibly awesome [Unreasonable at Sea](http://unreasonableatsea.com/) tribe tomorrow which will most likely mean that The Heretic will take a bit of a break (or at least will not appear daily in your inbox).

We're back on May 1st with our regular schedule!

In the meantime: Please keep your questions, suggestions and ideas coming!

P.S. This goes to show that I actually write each post on the day it is published. I like it that way. :)
