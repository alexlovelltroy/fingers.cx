title: The Heretic Network
---
Here's a whacky idea: You guys rock. I know that there are a whole bunch of you who are experts in a specific domain and have built companies around their expertise. We have people who built a successful project management tool, a payment processing company, fashion companies, all sorts of web services and so on. We have experts in user experience design, backend development, cloud computing…

**Wouldn't it be amazing if we, as the Heretic tribe, help each other out?**

With that being said – let's create the Heretic network. If you're willing to help fellow Heretics with your expertise, send me an email with your name, your preferred contact email address, your area of expertise in 140 characters or less and, if you want, a link to your homepage, company page, whatever it is that is related to your offer. I'll put them all on a page which we will link to from the newsletter (and only from the newsletter – I don't want to overwhelm you).

_One ask: Don't see this as an opportunity to sell your services or your product. This is about helping each other out. No strings attached._

**Let's pay it forward.**
