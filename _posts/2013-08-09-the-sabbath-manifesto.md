title: The Sabbath Manifesto
---
Yesterday I reposted the [Tale of two Lumbarjacks](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-today/8f71fcf9a81d) on Medium – which made me realize that Jane and I always wanted to follow the [Sabbath Manifesto](http://www.sabbathmanifesto.org/).

Somehow we never made it stick for more than a week or two. There was always something urgent, burning, something which needed tending to. It kinda sucks that I am not able to switch off for a single day per week. And then it hit me – when we first tried to follow the Sabbath Manifesto we did this on Sundays. Sundays don't work for us – there is always some work which needs to be prepared for the week, some emails to be answered, that kind of thing.

So now we try this again – this time we pick Saturdays. Wish me luck – and call me out if I break my self-imposed axe-sharpening time off. :) Oh - and this also means that you won't get a Heretic tomorrow (as I never prepare them and literally write what's on my mind in the moment). Sorry.

And while we're talking about this – why not join us and take tomorrow off? Spend time with your loved ones, reflect, recharge and think about the big picture.

See you Sunday.
