title: Energy begets Energy
---
People often ask me how I manage to have a demanding day job (Mozilla), publish a daily newsletter (The Heretic), mentor and advise at any given time between 10 and 15 companies, engage with wonderful organizations such as the Unreasonable Institute, work out and still have a life.

It has less to do with work ethic and the drive to succeed than with motor movement. When you're physically wiped out, motor movements produces adrenaline for the mind and body.

In my best moments I feel like floating – and with every bit of workload I add more energy into the system.

**The magic is to do what you love doing. The rest takes care of itself.**
