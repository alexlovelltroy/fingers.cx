title: The strangest places

I have written opinion pieces and columns for a few magazines here and there - from FAST Company to a quarterly magazine published by a trend research institute based in the Netherlands to a monthly column for the Unreasonable Institute. But the coolest one must be my recent "mentor speak" piece for Inc. Magazine India (!).

They ran a story about InMobi, an Indian startup which opened offices in a ton of countries very early on and wanted to have my point of view on the broader topic of internationalization (something I am deeply passionate about - being European and seeing so many of my fellow European entrepreneurs missing opportunities as they never take the plunge and bring their companies across borders).

[Here's the story](http://issuu.com/incindia/docs/inc_india-vol-3-issue-11-december-2012) (flip to page 35 for my comment).

Fun stuff.
