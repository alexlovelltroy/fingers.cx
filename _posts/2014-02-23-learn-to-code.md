## Stop talking and build it
Non-technical founders often ask me how to learn to code.  It's not that they want to write software, they simply want to understand enough so that they can talk to their development team.

I added my best advice against learning to code [yesterday](/2014/02/22/dont-learn-to-code/).  Read it and see if it applies to you.

If not, you're a builder.  You're someone who not only wants to talk about the development process, but wants to get involved.  Great!  Don't ask permission, build something.

## Build Something Today

All programmers start out the same way.  We write something that doesn't work and keep refining it until we can get it to work.  You can do that too, and you should start today.  Here's a few resources you can start with, but you're going to need to ask a lot of questions.

1. Don't get lost in tools.  For iphone development, there's a lot that goes in to getting started because you have to learn the tools first.

2. Take it day by day and don't expect to finish anything in one day.

3. Have fun.  If building your first piece of software feels like a chore, see yesterdays advice and find a contractor instead.
