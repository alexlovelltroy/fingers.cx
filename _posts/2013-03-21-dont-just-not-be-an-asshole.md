title: Don't just not be an asshole
---
For the longest time now I follow and encourage others to follow the most basic rule of human interaction: **Don't be an asshole.** It even made it into the [GyShiDo manifesto](http://gyshido.com/).

This morning, over coffee, I thought about this when it hit me: I love connecting people. Seeing what happens when you bring amazing people together is just beautiful. My passion for connecting people even led me to advise a startup ([Intros.to](http://intros.to/)) which is changing the way we make introductions and gives powerful tools to connectors like me.

I realized this morning that I make significantly more connections for only a handful of people (and receive tons and tons of introductions from them in return). The thing all these people have in common: They are not only **not** assholes â€“ they are completely amazing, lovingly, empathetic human beings. They are the people I would go through a fire for.

Which brings me to my point: At the bare minimum don't be an asshole. **And** strive to truly care about other people. You will not only feel good about yourself but will be rewarded handsomely in so many ways.
