title: Stay Stupid
---
Here are the three dumbest people I can think of: Steve Jobs, Elon Musk and Richard Branson.

Why?

Because any smart person understands that what they set out to do is impossible. And yet.

You have to be clueless enough to have no idea how difficult it will be. Stay stupid. Don't think. Act.
