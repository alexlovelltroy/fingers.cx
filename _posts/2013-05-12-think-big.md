title: Think Big
---
I am guilty as charged: Most people don't think big enough.

It is completely within your power to change this. Think big, execute small. Set out your vision, figure out what needs to be done to get there and then get to work.

And never forget that the only way to inspire greatness in others is by seeing this greatness in them first.

"When we treat man as he is, we make him worse than he is; if we treat him if he already were what he potentially could be, we make him what he should be." ~ J.W. von Goethe

**We need you to think big. You don't need permission.**
