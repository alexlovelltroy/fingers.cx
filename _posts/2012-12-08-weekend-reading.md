Fellow Heretics,

I'll keep it short today - here's some amazing weekend reading for you. Mary Meeker has been right about the big trends on the web way more often than not. So every time she releases one of her reports you better spend some time digesting it - as Mary sees the future.

[Here is her latest report](http://cl.ly/LRwL). As a special service to you - in handy PDF format for convenient reading.

Have a wonderful weekend!
