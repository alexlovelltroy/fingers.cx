title: Weekend Reading - The Art of the Start
---
Let's keep this short and sweet today. Guy Kawasaki's [The Art of the Start](http://www.guykawasaki.com/the-art-of-the-start/) is hands-down the **one** book every tech entrepreneur must read.

**Read it. If you've read it before: Read it again.**

And if you're in the mood for more - here's my personal reading list for entrepreneurs:

- Guy Kawasaki's [The Art of the Start](http://www.guykawasaki.com/the-art-of-the-start/) - Yes, it's so good that I repeat it here!
- Steve Blank's [The Startup Owner's Manual](http://www.stevenblank.com/startup_index_qty.html) - A fantastic workbook which walks you through each and every step of the startup process.
- Anything and everything which [Peter Drucker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker) has ever written.
- Al Ries' and Jack Trouts' [Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind](http://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586) - Al and Jack will teach you everything you will ever need to know about branding and marketing.

I am somewhat lukewarm on Eric Ries' [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) - I believe the better book in this vain is Ash Maurya's [Running Lean](http://runninglean.co/).

And as I mentioned before - the one book you want to read again and again and again is Steven Pressfield's [Do the Work](http://www.stevenpressfield.com/do-the-work/).

I guess that's quite the list for the weekend. Enjoy!

P.S.: Here's a little birthday present from me to my fellow Heretics - Ash Maurya's Running Lean in a special first edition PDF which we created together with Ash for the launch of Mozilla's WebFWD. [Click here to download your personal copy](http://cl.ly/MbfN).

P.P.S.: Please note that Ash's book is copyrighted material - so please refrain from putting it up on Mega or The Pirate Bay. Thank you. :)
