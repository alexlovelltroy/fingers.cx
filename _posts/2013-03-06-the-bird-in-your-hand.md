title: The Bird in Your Hand
---
Recently someone asked me during my "[Mozilla for Entrepreneurs](https://speakerdeck.com/pfinette/mozilla-for-entrepreneurs)" talk what she should do if she doesn't have the means to start her idea.

The question threw me a bit off-balance – here's why: As an entrepreneur you should always adhere to the "**Bird in Hand Principle**":

Start with your means. Don't wait for the perfect opportunity. Start taking action, based on what you have readily available: what you are, what you know and who you know. There is never an excuse to not start – if the 15 year old [Jack Andraka](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Jack-Andraka-the-Teen-Prodigy-of-Pancreatic-Cancer-179996151.html) can develop a new method to detect pancreatic cancer, so can you start your endeavor. Start with what you have, the rest will come.

**Start now. There are no excuses.**
