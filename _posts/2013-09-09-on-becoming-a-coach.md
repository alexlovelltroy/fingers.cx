title: On Becoming a Coach
---
Let me share something personal with you – without any specific agenda or notion of saying something profound; just because I want to share this with you.

This weekend [Jane](http://janefinette.com/) and I started our journey to become (proper) coaches – we both enrolled into the [Coaches Institute](http://www.thecoaches.com/) Co-Active Coach Training program and completed our first course on Sunday night. It's an incredible journey and I can't wait to see where it will take me.

I (at the moment) have no plan to open my own coaching practice but intend to use my newfound skills in working with entrepreneurs, helping them with their journey.

Onward and upward. So exciting.
