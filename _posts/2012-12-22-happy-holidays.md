My dear Heretics,

What a crazy ride! A couple of weeks ago I thought about creating this little, weird experiment where I would send out a newsletter (like it's 1995) to share some thoughts and observations. Thanks to you it has been one heck of a fun time - thank you for subscribing and thank you even more for your feedback, the engaging discussions and your thoughtful emails.

I wish you all a wonderful holiday time - relax, enjoy some time off and get ready for one crazy 2013. Regardless what you do - I am sure that 2013 will be an incredible ride!

Make this your song for 2013 - I grew up on this and it became the official (well…) song of my platoon when I was a drill sergeant in the German air force:

[Extrabreit - Flieger grüss mir die Sonne…](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e61KF2eH3g)

Happy Holidays guys!

Pascal

P.S.: I will resume a more regular schedule of posts after the holidays.
