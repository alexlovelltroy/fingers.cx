NCWIT (the National Center for Women & Information Technology)  publishes a wonderful series of audio interviews with female entrepreneurs which they call "[Entrepreneurial Heroes](http://www.ncwit.org/project/entrepreneurial-heroes)".

There are something like 80 interviews in their library featuring amazing women such as Anousheh Ansari (first female private space explorer), Jessica Jackley (Kiva), Mitchell Baker (Mozilla), Ann Winblad and Caterina Fake (Flickr). The interviews go deeper than your usual "Tell us about yourself" BS - and the wonderful thing about women is: They don't have the need to tell the world how freakin' awesome they are but allow themselves to be vulnerable and share real insights.

This is great stuff.
