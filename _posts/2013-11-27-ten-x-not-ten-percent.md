title: 10X not 10%
---
Google has a mantra of "10x – not 10%" which, in its essence, boils down to: Make things which are ten times better than the status quo, not just incrementally better by a mere 10%.

It's funny – "10X – not 10%" is just another way of saying "Superior Products Matter". Which is rule number one (and two if you count in [Fight Club](http://www.diggingforfire.net/FightClub/) terms)  in my [entrepreneurship deck](https://speakerdeck.com/pfinette/mozilla-for-entrepreneurs?slide=17).

We talked about this before and I can not stress enough how important it is for you to think like this. If you're the challenger you need to shift the market. You need to produce something which is significantly better than the status quo. You  have to offer something which will make people lust for it. Otherwise… You're just an also-run or, worse, dead in the water.

**Ten X my dear heretics. Ten X. Let the others shoot for ten percent.**
