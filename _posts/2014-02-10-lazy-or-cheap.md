title: You can be lazy or cheap, but not both
---
One of my wife's favorite aphorisms is that you can be lazy or cheap, but not
both.  That's true whether you're choosing a vacation or building a business.
The longer you wait to start something, the less time you have to complete it
and the more likely you are to need an expert.

This is particularly important when you're a struggling entrepreneur.  Don't
wait to make the hard choices because you're lazy.  Paying your friend to do
substandard work because you can't bear to part with her only serves to burn
your cash and returns a poor product.  It also prevents her from finding the
place where she will fit in better.

Bite the bullet and do the hard thing that you know needs to be done.  Hesitation is expensive.
