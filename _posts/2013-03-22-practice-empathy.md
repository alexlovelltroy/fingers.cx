title: Practice Empathy
---
On the heels of [yesterday's post](http://theheretic.me/2013/03/21/dont-just-not-be-an-asshole/) and going back to something I learned from my friends at Intuit: You have to start the journey of your product from a position of deep customer empathy.

Too many products fail as they were conceived in an emotional vacuum, a space where we didn't care about the customer and figured we can make it "work".

You have to walk miles in your customers' shoes to truly understand them and create solutions which are meaningful **to them**. Some of the best products were built by people who felt an acute pain and need for the product they ended up building â€“ combining this "insight of one" with deep empathy for the broader community they targeted.

Practice empathy and you will not only build better products - but products that matter. And what could be more rewarding?
