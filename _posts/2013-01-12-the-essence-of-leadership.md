title: The Essence of Leadership
---
Recently I've been discussing the question of "What is the Essence of Leadership" with friends. For me it boils down to:

1. Develop the vision and long-term goals (this might be done just by you or preferably with your team).
2. Put the outcome into concise poetry.
3. Explain and then repeat the poetry. Repeat again and again, always using the same words as not to create any confusion.
4. Get out of the way and let your people do their job.

To make this work you need to spend time thinking. Find the right words. Make it short, concise and inspiring.

**Be a leader. Because your team needs you to be one.**
