title: No Fate But What We Make
---
Microsoft buys Nokia and announces that they will cut cost (meaning: fire people).

That reminds me of something one of my mentors told me early on in my career: There are no "secure jobs" anymore. You might think you are working for a stable company and will be able to keep doing this for as long as you want. Not so much.

You're much better off taking fate into your own hands. Be it by starting your own company or by managing your own career. Make no mistake: (Large) Companies have no loyalty towards their employees (especially not publicly traded ones). They have to do what is right for them – and if that means your job has to go, then so be it. You are just collateral damage.

**No Fate But What We Make.**
