title: Strengthen your Strengths
---
Forget about trying to iron out your weaknesses. Don't even try to get good at stuff you suck at today. All you will become is mediocre or decent (at best) at these things.

Instead focus on getting completely awesome at the stuff you're already good at. Strengthen your strengths. Because you can become a superstar in those areas.

Surround yourself with people who are amazing at the stuff you suck at. And just make sure that the stuff you're not good at today is at a level which doesn't kill you.

Otherwise: Be awesome! Because we need you to be incredible.
