title: Ask. Just ask.

Here's a lesson in the power of asking.

I'm a big fan Seth Godin's work. With my new role at Mozilla I thought it would be really interesting get some advice from Seth. So I emailed him.

Long shot, right?

I mean - come on. Seth is super-busy. Surely gets a gazillion emails a day. And guaranteed: He has better things to do than to consider my completely unreasonable suggestion of having dinner together when he's next in the Bay area.

Guess what?

Seth replied within 10 minutes (no kidding) and we're having dinner when he's here next.

Just ask.

Simply, freakin' ask.

The worst thing which can happen is you get rejected. Big deal. Ask again.
