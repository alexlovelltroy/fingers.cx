title: Don't learn to code
---
## Learning to code may be climbing the wrong mountain
Non-technical founders often ask me how to learn to code.  It's not that they want to write software, they simply want to understand enough so that they can talk to their development team.

We unpack that desire together and it is almost always rooted in insecurity.  How can they provide clear direction if they can't understand the situation on the ground?  That's fantastic.  They should understand what's going on.  They need to be able to make hard decisions about which good ideas to leave for another time.  But, learning to code isn't going to get them there.  Finding and trusting good technical people will get them there.  They need to choose the people they work with carefully.  It's most important to be able to communicate with them.  Just below that is the need for technical expertise.

Learning to code isn't like learning vocabulary.  It's about building something.  And, as with any situation where plans become concrete, there are adaptations.  There is experience in play.  And, in the best programmers, there is passion.

So, here's the advice that I've given at least a dozen times.

> Don't learn to code. Find your favorite programmer and trust him or her to be amazing.   Then, when you get confused, ask enough questions to understand.
