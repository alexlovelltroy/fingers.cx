title: The Event Bet
---
Events are a wonderful way to grow your network. And if you're anything like me, you somewhat dread attending them. As good as I might be in interacting with people I at least somewhat know – I am not great at interacting in larger groups of people I don't know (i.e. your typical larger event).

With that in mind – here's my (not so) secret trick: Every time I attend an event I make a bet with myself that I will meet five new people. Turning the task into an internal bet wakes my competitive spirit and kicks me into action.

Try it out.
