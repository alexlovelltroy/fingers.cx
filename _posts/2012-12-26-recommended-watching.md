Given that the holidays are "down time" for most/some of us - here's two documentaries which you ought to see:

1. [Steve Jobs - The lost Interview](http://www.magpictures.com/stevejobsthelostinterview/) : This interview is incredible. It's inspiring, insightful and raw. Even if you don't like the man, it's pretty much a must-watch. You'll find it on most streaming services (if you're an Amazon Prime member you can watch it for free).

2. [Startup.com](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256408/) : Ever wonder how life was during the first dot-com boom & bust. Startup.comtakes you on a journey which is as true today as it was back in the late 90's.

Enjoy! And let me know how you like 'em.
