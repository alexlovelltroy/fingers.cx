title: Reject Group Thinking
---
Are you working on something which requires creativity? Say your marketing campaign, a clever algorithm or your new business model?

Then think about this: Decisive, breakthrough creative decision-making is almost always made by one, two, or possibly three minds working in unison, take it or leave it. Collective thinking often leads to stalemate, mediocrity or worse. And the _smarter_ the individuals in the group, the harder it is to nail the idea.

That doesn't mean that you should not listen to others, consider a multitude of viewpoints and engage with your customers. But resist the urge to "[design by committee](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/29/why-design-by-commitee-should-die/)".
