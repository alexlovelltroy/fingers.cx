title: Never walk.
---
A few days ago a friend of mine asked me for my favorite quote. At the time I couldn't decide - there are just so many amazing, insightful quotes which can act as a mantra, a guiding principle, a pick-me-upâ€¦

This morning I realized that I heard a quote a while ago which seems to guide me more than any other. It's from Steve Prefontaine, one of the most inspiring runners of all times.

> "The only good race pace is suicide pace, and today looks like a good day to die."

That's pretty much how I live life. Suicide Pace. Life is too short for mediocrity.
