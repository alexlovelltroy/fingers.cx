I recently read the following story:

A guy went to a bar and ordered a cocktail. Before sipping his drink, he asked the bartender, "Is this the best Bloody Mary you can make?"

"Yes, Sir," the bartender answered with assurance.

"Taste it," the guest ordered.

The bartender sipped and reflected. "It's delicious," he decided.

"Can you make a *better* one?"

The bartender mixed a new Bloody Mary.

"Now taste this one and tell me what you think," asked the guest again.

The bartender took a sip. "This is very good. It's perfect."

**"Then why the fuck didn't you make it that way in the first place?"** barked the guest.

*Remember this story every time you do anything in life, including sweeping the floor and washing the dishes.*
