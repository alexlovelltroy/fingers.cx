title: No Fate But What We Make
---
This weekend, in my final coaches training session (aptly called "Synergy") we had to share our story: How we came to coaching, what happened to us during the coaching program and what change we want to see for ourselves in the future.

It's a wonderful ritual and it's incredible to hear other people's journey, witness and acknowledge them. Thinking about my own journey and hearing the stories from my fellow executive coaches it struck me how alike our stories are - and how much they are also the story of every entrepreneur.

And it made me think of Sarah Connor's voice-over toward the end of "Terminator 2 Judgement Day":

_"The future, always so clear to me, has become like a black highway at night. We were in uncharted territory now... making up history as we went along."_

**There's no fate but what we make for ourselves my fellow Heretics. The future is ours to be written. Go forth and make history my dear friends!**
