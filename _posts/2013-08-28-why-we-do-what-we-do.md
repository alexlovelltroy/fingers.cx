title: Why we do what we do
---
Every once in awhile someone asks me why I do what I do. Why I get up in the morning. Why I am not content with an exciting day job but do all the other things I do. Heck – why I even write The Heretic.

I thought a lot about this.

There are many reasons why I do exactly what I do. I love helping people. Entrepreneurship is my passion. Connecting humans and seeing magic happen makes me happy. I care deeply about leaving places in a better state than I found them.

But the thing which gets me most, the thing which really drives me is:

**Doing something for the sheer joy of making the very first footprints in a field of virgin snow**.

I thrive on creating something new. Venturing into uncharted territory. Leaping into the void. And I bet you money that this is (most likely) what connects us…

Welcome to the tribe fellow Heretics!
