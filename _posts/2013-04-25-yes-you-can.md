As most of you know by now I have the great fortune to be part of [Unreasonable at Sea](http://unreasonableatsea.com/) – an endeavor which is best described in their own words: "A radical experiment in global entrepreneurship to combat the greatest challenges of our time."

And yet: The journey itself is not what makes this so special. It's the [companies](http://unreasonableatsea.com/companies22/) and the people behind them who are the true source of sheer inspiration and amazement. Take [Solar Ear](http://unreasonableatsea.com/solar-ear/), a company which invented and produces the world’s first digitally programmable and rechargeable hearing aids. Not only do they bring a solar rechargeable hearing aid to places people didn't have access to hearing aids before (or if they did couldn't use them as they quickly ran out of batteries and couldn't buy new ones), they also produce this hearing aid for half the price of their competitors **and** build their products in a factory which employs hearing impaired people.

Sounds amazing, crazy, impossible? Sure. And yet - the founder is the sweetest, humblest person you will ever meet. He's a mere human, not a prodigy with five degrees from different universities and a rich family in his background. And I'll bet you money that you could do the same if you just put your mind to it.

**Never doubt your abilities.**

P.S. Please excuse the irregular schedule - I'm at [Unreasonable at Sea](http://theheretic.me/2013/04/17/unreasonably-excited) at the moment. :)
