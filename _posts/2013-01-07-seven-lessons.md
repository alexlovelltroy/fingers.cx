title: Seven Lessons
---
In 2009 John Lilly, Mozilla's former CEO and now a partner at Uber-VC firm Greylock, gave a talk about the "7 Lessons from Mozilla" at the Wordpress "WordCamp" conference.

It is one of my favorite talks and one which has deeply influenced my thinking. I went on to have lots and lots of discussions with John, took his ideas and refined them over the years - now you can find them in pretty much every single talk I give.

[You should watch it](http://wordpress.tv/2009/07/08/john-lilly-mozilla/). It's watching a master doing his art.
