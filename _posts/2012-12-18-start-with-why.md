title: Start with Why
---
By now I guess (hope?) most of you are intimately familiar with Simon Sinek's work "Start with Why". No? Well - time to watch [this TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html). You might want to [read his book](http://www.amazon.com/Start-Why-Leaders-Inspire-Everyone/dp/1591846447/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1355881955&sr=8-1&keywords=simon+sinek) as well.

I fundamentally believe that his model is right. It's a bit of an oversimplification - but it's right. The reason why I am at Mozilla is because we start with the whyâ€¦

**Why?**

Mozilla promotes openness, innovation and opportunity on the web.

**That's all?**

Yes! Because it's important.

**How?**

By creating great software and building movements that give people the tools to take control of their online lives.

**What?**

Oh - we build this awesome web browser. Do you want to use it?

See what I mean? Start with why.
