title: Ignore the Critics
---
There are two types of critics: The ones who provide valuable feedback, who are helping you make things better, who are showing you opportunities you haven't yet seen. And then the ones who are telling you that it can't be done. That it's not good enough. That nobody will care.

Fucking ignore the latter ones. They don't do anything for you. They are poison and have no place in your life.

Seek out the former ones as they will make you better. They are your allies.

Sometimes you can turn the nay-sayers around. Before you tell them to get out of your life ask them what they would do to make it better. If they don't have an answer â€“ move on. You deserve better than that.
