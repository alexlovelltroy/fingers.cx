title: Products and Movements
---
I've been thinking about products and movements quite a bit today. Mozilla builds products. And movements. The piece which is interesting is that we don't differentiate. Firefox is a product. And a movement.

People use our products because of functionality - and because they believe in what we do and how we do it.

That's incredibly powerful.

Last night I closed my Instagram account. Exported all my pictures and closed the account. I was an early Instagram user. But they are just a product. Not a movement. I can find photo filters in dozen of other apps these days. I don't need their functionality anymore. They are not a movement.

Are you still building just a product or are you working on creating meaning in the world?
