title: The Mantra Economy
---
Startup Vitamins sells you a [set of "motivational" posters](http://www.startupvitamins.com/products/startup-poster-monster-pack) with such wonderful startup truisms as "Think Bigger" or "Experiment. Fail. Learn. Repeat." for the bargain price of $575 for a set of 20.

It's kinda funny – on one hand I find myself repeating (and writing about) some of those mantras myself, on the other hand shit like that makes me puke.

Not sure what to make out of this… One thing I know though: Having these things on your wall does nothing for you (well, it makes you and your cash-strapped startup $575 lighter). You have to act upon them.

Hmm… 

Call me out when I talk bullshit, will you?
