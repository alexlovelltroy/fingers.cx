			<h3>THE MANIFESTO</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="large-9 columns">
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4>Create something meaningful</h4>
					<p>The world doesn't need another social-local-mobile piece of shit. We need <strong>you</strong> to show up and make something magnitudes better than the status quo. <strong>Build superior products</strong> – as mediocrity is boring and exhausting.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Do the work</h4>
					<p>Our enemy is not lack of preparation; it's not the difficulty of the project, or the state of the marketplace or the emptiness of our bank account. The enemy is resistance. <strong>Start before you're ready.</strong></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>There are no maps</h4>
					<p>Actually that's not true – there are maps. They are just not yours… Blaze your own path and create <strong>your</strong> map.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Pay it forward</h4>
					<p>Openly share, collaborate, encourage, mentor, trust, love. Develop deep empathy for the people around you and on the other side of the planet. We need to fix the mess we're in. Only entrepreneurs <strong>like you</strong> can do this.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Have fun</h4>
					<p>When it comes down to it – it's the only thing that matters. If you're not having fun do something else. Life is too short.</p>

			<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="large-9 columns">
			<p>The Heretic came to life as an experiment. Pascal (that's me) wanted to have a way to share thoughts and ideas which felt less polished than a blog post and more meaningful than a tweet.</p>
			<p>So I set up a newsletter. Originally I planned on sending an email every once in a while, talking about whatever comes to mind. Turns out – I obsess about entrepreneurship, startups, makers, creators, rebels and misfits. People and ideas who change the world. And so I ended up sending out my little newsletter to a small and growing community of like-minded people on a daily basis.</p>
			<p>Today The Heretic is still, at its core, a newsletter. We are a community of hundreds of crazy people. And you should <span class="highlight"><a href="/#subscribe">join</a></span>.</p>
			<p>I will do my very best to feed your mind. And I am not alone – along the way I picked up a bunch of dissenters who share their perspectives and deep insights into particular areas of the entrepreneurs' world.</p>
			<p>You can learn more about me and my background on my <a href="http://finette.com/">personal homepage</a> and <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/pfinette">LinkedIn</a>. I co-created the <a href="http://gyshido.com/">GyShiDo movement</a>, which you should sign up to. And don't be a stranger - leave comments, send me emails & tweets and connect with me.</p>
