`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
  And the mome raths outgrabe.<br />
<br />
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br />
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br />
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br />
He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br />
  Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br />
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br />
  And stood awhile in thought.<br />
And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br />
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br />
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br />
  And burbled as it came!<br />
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br />
  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br />
He left it dead, and with its head<br />
  He went galumphing back.<br />
"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br />
  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br />
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br />
  He chortled in his joy.<br />
<br />
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br />
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br />
  And the mome raths outgrabe.<br />
  <br />
