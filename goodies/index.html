			<p>The Heretic Network is a group of fellow Heretics who kindly offered their time and expertise to help you on your own journey. It all started with <a href="http://theheretic.me/2013/12/08/the-heretic-network/">this post</a>. It's us paying it forward.</p>
         <p><strong>Consider this your Heretic rolodex of awesomeness.</strong></p>
			<p>Feel free to reach out to them. And please don't forget: These wonderful folks are doing this out of gratitude - please treat them like the messiah.</p>
			<p>And <a href="mailto:hello@theheretic.me">email me</a> when something cool came out of a collaboration, when you want to offer your own expertise to fellow Heretics or when you just want to say Hi.</p>
