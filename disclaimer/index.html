			<p>The Heretic and any associated writing solely reflects my personal opinion. Nothing I publish under The Heretic is in any way, shape or form related to or the opinion of my current or former employer or companies, organizations or individuals I advise.</p>
			<p>Blah, blah, blah… You get the idea.</p>
			<p>It's simply me rambling, ranting and speaking out loud. Sometimes without too much thought, often with extensive use of swear words.</p>
			<p>If you don't like it – that's fine. Simply don't read it.</p>
			<p><strong>And always remember:</strong> The Heretic is what worked for me. That doesn't mean that it will work for you. <a href="/2013/02/11/no-maps/">Create your own map!</a></p>
