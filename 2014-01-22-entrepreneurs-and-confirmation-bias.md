title: Dream Big!

Confirmation Bias is a tendency of people to favor information that confirms
their beliefs.  It's generally a bad thing and leads to terrible decisions. 
On the other hand, it can be freeing and wonderful when you're brainstorming.
Envision a world in which your idea has *won*, without constraints on reality.

Dream big!

Only after you feel like you can really see the world as a different and better
place because of your idea is it time to come back to earth and think
critically about it.  But be sure to save your dream.  Write it down and refer
to it.  See how many of the limits and critiques that were roadblocks in the
past can be swept away leaving you with your wonderful dream.

Dreams fuel entrepreneurship.
